The soldiers cheer. Credits.</p><p  class='text-p'>Cersei volunteers to run the elections. House Lannister places voting booths in all reaches of Westeros and every citizen in the Seven Kingdoms writes their desired ruler’s name on a ballot. The ballots are then all shipped to King’s Landing where Cersei counts the votes and announces the winner.</p><p  class='text-p'>The process goes through and Cersei is excited to announce that she won. Would you trust these elections?</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>As it turns out, not all democracies are equal. If you’re interested to see the leaderboard, check out how every country ranks at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index#Democracy_Index_by_country_2018" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>2018 Democracy Index:</a></p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>Most of the countries in the list, notably those with the low ranking in red, openly pride themselves as being democratic and celebrate periodic elections where the populous get a chance to choose their leaders. But evidently, some democratic processes are prone to manipulation allowing existing leaders to maintain their positions of power regardless of where the populous tries to shift it.</p><p  class='text-p'>Pseudo-democracies are not the only ones with problems. There are issues with the top 15% in the list. Take a look at the US for example, number 25 in the list and the historical epitome of modern democracy (no cynicism intended). “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/01/this-is-the-best-explanation-of-gerrymandering-you-will-ever-see" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Gerrymandering</a>” is one example of a US problem where the political party in power can draw lines between voting districts that are favorable to itself.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>Democracies are complicated to implement, the nuances are plenty. And through their analysis and criticism, we have the chance to improve on them. To design processes that better guarantee their purity and withstand corruption.</p><p  class='text-p'>Proof-of-Stake systems behave in a very similar way. Voting, or the degree of influence, is based on ownership of stake instead of citizenship, but otherwise, the process is prone to similar nuances and must be designed to withstand manipulation. We must also continuously criticize PoS implementations so we have the chance to improve them.</p><p  class='text-p'>And surely - there is plenty of criticism of PoS in the crypto world. The spectrum ranges from belief that the problems of PoS are solvable, debating the pros and cons of various implementations, to outright skepticism whether PoS can work at all.</p><p  class='text-p'>Take for example the views of Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of ConsenSys, from the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaWxIwaGvLQ" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Deconomy</a>: <em>“How about EOS? As has been debated endlessly, a platform controlled by 21 crypto bros is just not all that decentralized. They can collude and censor if they wish. Governments and other well-resourced actors can bribe them or force them to act against their will and against the well being and the security of the people using the platform”</em>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s try to analyze Lubin’s argument why EOS, the dominant PoS implementation to date, is flawed. The 21 elected nodes of EOS <em>“can collude and censor if they wish.”</em> But what would happen if these nodes indeed collude against the interests of the entire network? If the effects aren’t minor, like a decline in token price, stakeholders will spring to action and just replace the colluding nodes. Elections on EOS rely on stake of the entirety of the network, and the majority of stake is assumed to be honest. So where’s the risk?</p><p  class='text-p'>The risk is only if the colluding nodes could prevent their own replacement. The core of the matter, in my opinion, is that <em>they are the ones running the elections</em>. They are the ones counting the votes.</p><p  class='text-p'>This isn’t all that different from Cersei counting the Westeros votes by herself.</p><p  class='text-p'>The majority of PoS implementations are <strong>closed systems</strong>. The voting process is part of the protocol and the protocol is executed by nodes running the network, that are chosen according to the protocol. There is an essence of circular trust here.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>What about Proof-of-Work algorithms? Is PoW prone to the same circular trust weakness?</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Not really. Albeit its shortcomings in terms of efficiency and cost, PoW has several wonderful properties making it an excellent choice for decentralized trust. The primary of which is strong <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>objectivity</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Objectivity</strong> (I’m using Vitalik’s definition here) means that <em>a new node coming onto the network with no knowledge except (i) the protocol definition and (ii) the set of all blocks and other “important” messages that have been published can independently come to the exact same conclusion as the rest of the network on the current state.</em></p><p  class='text-p'>What does this mean? Let’s say I’m an observer of the network and I want to be convinced that the state presented by the nodes in the network is indeed the “correct” one. Am I able to verify everything all by myself?</p><p  class='text-p'>I can easily verify the amount of work in PoW by myself (that’s the point, hashes are easy to verify but hard to produce). And since PoW algorithms work according to the longest chain rule, I can objectively know which competing portrayals of the state (competing forks) is the right one.</p><p  class='text-p'>You can say, in a sense, that the work itself is <strong>external to the system</strong>, and since the system is not closed anymore and does not vouch for itself using itself only, it becomes very trustworthy.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>The <em>objectivity</em> property is unique to PoW (and similar methods like <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>VDFs</a>) but missing from most PoS implementations, leading to the circular trust weakness of a closed system.</p><p  class='text-p'>Why is the lack of <em>objectivity</em> painful in PoS networks? The core offering of these networks is trust. As clients of the network, we should be able to verify the correctness of the relevant state and transactions. Verifying the correctness of data requires knowledge of the elected validators, since they are the ones allowed to sign blocks. In order to verify the elected validators, one can attempt to verify the election calculations. However, the calculations and the votes reside on the chain itself, signed by the same validators that we’re trying to verify in the first place. This cyclic dependency prevents the client from objectively verifying the correctness of their data. There are workarounds like trusting one of the validators, but these solutions are suboptimal. When our core offering is trust, we should hold ourselves to a higher standard.</p><p  class='text-p'>If we could add <em>objectivity</em> to PoS, this will provide us with the missing <strong>external oversight</strong> - and give us a PoS implementation that is much more trustworthy. This will also give a pretty good answer to Lubin’s fears that the elected nodes in the system can collude and censor (particularly regarding the voting process that elects them).</p><p  class='text-p'>So, is it possible to use PoW for this purpose without affecting the efficiency of PoS? There is a straightforward way to do this and it’s actually pretty simple. All you have to do is store the votes externally - preferably on a different decentralized network that is based on PoW.</p><p  class='text-p'>Going back to our Westeros example, this would mean that the voting booths where the ballots are stored, will no longer be under Lannister control. The voting booths will be controlled by somebody else (external to the Game of Thrones universe) that will guarantee the sanctity of the elections. Once the elections have been made, whichever king is elected is free to rule inside Westeros without external involvement.</p><p  class='text-p'>The last part is important. If we are to maintain the efficiency of PoS, the rest of the network operation - mainly executing smart contracts on the PoS network, storing the state under consensus, doing everything a blockchain does - must not rely on PoW anymore. The only thing PoW will provide is an <strong>external guarantee of objectivity</strong> that will let any observer confirm that the PoS network is not colluding and has indeed been purely elected.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is how this approach is different from layer 2 solutions. Second layers delegate all security and trust to the base layer. The base layer can overturn smart contract results, for example, or override state modifications made by the second layer. Our approach will still make the PoS system retain its own security and trust and thus hold value of its own.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>So how would that work in practice?</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>The natural choice for a PoW network to store election votes is <em>Ethereum</em>. It is popular and obviously secure enough (in terms of hash power) as a standard of trust to be sufficiently disconnected incentives-wise from our own PoS network, and its smart contracts offer the flexibility for a proper integration.</p><p  class='text-p'>If storing election votes on Ethereum is a simple solution, why don’t we see more PoS blockchains taking this approach?</p><p  class='text-p'>One reason may be ego. Many PoS systems position themselves as potential “Ethereum-killers” - the scalable place to run apps until Ethereum reaches its own scalability milestones. Elections are also a crucial part of your solution, and using somebody else for a crucial part may “leak” some of your own perceived value to this somebody. We don’t share these views at Orbs. We see enormous value in existing ecosystems that have already been built. Not everything has to be replaced. We attempt to use existing infrastructures where they show advantage in order to make our own solution better.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another reason this approach is difficult for many PoS blockchains is the utility of the token used for staking. Most PoS systems rely on the token for settlement related to the main purpose of these platforms - running apps. In other words, app developers use the token to pay nodes for running their apps.</p><p  class='text-p'>Performing staking on Ethereum will also mean the utility of payment for app execution will have to be done on Ethereum as well. Since most PoS systems rely on a per-transaction gas model and aim for very high transaction throughputs, this would make Ethereum fees (in Ether) extremely high and inefficient - and thus miss the whole point of the efficiency of PoS.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is another place where the Orbs architecture comes to our advantage. We’ve made a product decision long ago (see the original <a href="https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-position-paper/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Position Paper</a>) to have apps pay <em>monthly subscription</em> fees to Orbs nodes for executing their apps, instead of a per-transaction gas model. This product decision brings multiple benefits crucial for a pragmatic app execution platform such as predictable fees and the ability for apps to subsidize their users’ fees to encourage adoption (the same way Facebook subsidizes your Messenger costs and doesn’t charge you for their infrastructure fees per sending each chat message). This is part of our strategy to bring the AWS product experience to app developers in blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>Apps on Orbs run on <a href="https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/blockchain-virtualization-a-necessity-for-real-world-dapps/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>virtual chains</a> that have dedicated and isolated resources. Subscriptions for resource dedication in virtual chains are paid monthly (or even longer if you want to guarantee future data availability). Making the payment once a month on Ethereum means Ether fees are negligible. There will be no impact on the efficiency of PoS.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs network is a PoS-based blockchain. It relies on the ORBS token which is used for paying infrastructure fees for running apps and also for staking and electing validators. The voting process is performed on Ethereum and thus ORBS is an ERC20 token.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs is not a layer 2 for Ethereum though. Orbs does not delegate security and trust to Ethereum, and holds its own value in its permissionless validator pool based on the PoS ecosystem of the ORBS token and its incentives model. Ethereum provides an <strong>external objective guarantee</strong> that any observer can verify that elected nodes on Orbs are indeed the ones the stakeholders voted for. For this important governance function, Ethereum is a crucial component in the Orbs design.</p><p  class='text-p'>Apps running on Orbs are not executed on Ethereum, allowing them to fully enjoy the efficiency and decentralization in PoS, extremely low operation fees, extremely high scale and many other Orbs-specific benefits such as governance isolation, smart contracts in any language and more.</p><p  class='text-p'>Learn more about Orbs <a href="https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="../white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

<p  class='text-p'>We recently announced that Orbs has been fully integrated into Amazon AMI and MS Azure:</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-live-on-amazon-ami-published-by-aws-marketplace/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs Live on Amazon - AMI Published by AWS Marketplace</a></p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-is-live-on-microsoft-azure/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs is Live on MS Azure!</a></p><p  class='text-p'>From now on, you can also find Orbs on Google Cloud!</p><p  class='text-p'>Together with AWS and Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud completes the top 3 cloud infrastructure platforms with the vast majority of market share. Having Orbs integrated into all three ensure that the majority of developers will be able to set up a virtual machine image, on the respective platform, containing everything needed to start developing on Orbs.</p><p  class='text-p'>Click <a href="https://docs.orbs.network/contract-sdk/gamma-in-depth/deploying-gamma-in-the-cloud" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a> for instructions on how to use the Orbs Mirror Imaging on AWS, MS Azure, as well as Google Cloud:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-is-live-on-google-cloud/Screen-Shot-2021-05-03-at-10.02.26-1030x685.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>From there you will be navigated to the Google Cloud Marketplace where you will be able to find the Orbs Developer Kit.

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
