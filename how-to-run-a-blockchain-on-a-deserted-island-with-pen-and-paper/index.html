If you wish to comment or clap, please visit the</em> <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper-899949ec555b" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>original publication here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p  class='text-p'>If you’re ever stranded on a deserted island, knowing how to run the process of <em>decentralized consensus</em> — or in other words, operate a very simple blockchain by hand — can prove to be very useful. All you need is some fellow survivors, this post, a pen and a few pieces of paper.</p><p  class='text-p'>If you’re not certain this skill is useful for your survival, be sure to read <a href="https://medium.com/@talkol/why-decentralized-consensus-blockchain-is-good-for-business-5ff263468210" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>my last post</a> on how blockchain can vastly improve island life.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s go back to that original story and go through the process with our fearless heroes, who just crashed on a deserted island somewhere in the South Pacific — <strong>Hugo</strong>, <strong>Sawyer</strong>, <strong>Kate</strong> and <strong>Jack</strong>.</p><p  class='text-p'>A short recap: the gang is trying to implement <em>IslandCoin</em>, a revolutionary new currency that will bring an end to the island’s crippled barter economy. The gang has agreed it’s fair if each of them starts with 100 coins. Since they don’t have metal to mint actual coins, they’ll have to make do with a few pieces of paper. Riddled with trust issues, the gang hasn’t been able to agree on one person to keep track of balances. Their only option is to maintain the balances <em>together</em>.</p><p  class='text-p'>We’ll start with what is probably the simplest blockchain implementation for our island use case. In future posts we can explore other implementations and tie them to concepts like <em>Proof of Work</em> and <em>Proof of Stake —</em> this will help us see their benefits and drawbacks. But for now, let’s start as simple as it gets.</p><p  class='text-p'>What are we trying to achieve? It’s very simple actually — all we’re trying to do is maintain a simple table of balances on a piece of paper. This table will show how many coins each of our heroes has. The trick is, because we can’t have <em>one</em> piece of paper that holds the only source of truth — we’re going to have to keep things equal and let each of the gang maintain their own version — this is the <em>decentralized</em> part. And naturally, we’re also going to hope that all 4 pieces of paper eventually show the same thing — this is the <em>consensus</em> part.</p><p  class='text-p'>So what would this piece of paper look like?</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*lcFfUboJfzFlgOKHj77QEg.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>This paper is the <em>first</em> one we agree on — that’s why it’s marked as day 1. Where did these balances come from? We’ve previously agreed it’s fair that each of the gang starts with 100 coins. We’re also going to need one of the survivors to write this paper. It doesn’t really matter who, so let’s take Hugo. He will be the one to publish this paper to everybody and make sure they each save a copy (the island has an amazing photocopy machine, I forgot to mention).</p><p  class='text-p'>Since coin balances are expected to change, we’re going to create a new updated piece of paper at the end of every day. It may not always be Hugo who publishes the update though — we want to keep things as fair as possible after all.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another important part, due to the lack of mutual trust in the group, is having each of the gang confirm the status update individually. An easy way to achieve this is having each one of the survivors sign each of the papers — but only if they agree with what’s written on it.</p><p  class='text-p'>How many people need to sign a paper for it to be considered final and approved? We need to reach <em>consensus</em>, so a majority will do. Since we have 4 people in total, a majority is at least 3 out of 4. The paper above was signed by all four so it’s definitely final. Why don’t we want to require all four signatures on all papers? Because this will allow one individual to jeopardize the entire process. If Sawyer goes on a fishing trip for a few days, the gang can’t update balances until he gets back — this gives one person too much power. Why do we even need a majority? Why isn’t 2 out of 4 signatures enough? Because if we only require 2 out of 4, we may end up with 2 people (like Hugo and Sawyer) signing one version of balances, and the other 2 people (Kate and Jack) signing a different version that doesn’t match. We can’t have two conflicting versions of reality both considered final.</p><p  class='text-p'>On the morning of the second day, Kate wants to buy a tomato. Hugo sells tomatoes for 2 coins each. She wants to transfer 2 coins to Hugo. Kate takes a new piece of paper and writes the transfer on it:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*RxkRElLi-s1bC3etoROohA.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>It’s Kate’s first action ever, so she labels it as such. In addition, Kate signs this paper. We have to have her signature to make sure nobody else can forge a transfer request on her account.</p><p  class='text-p'>The end of the second day is approaching and the gang wants to publish an updated set of balances. Hugo published the paper for the first day and collected everybody’s signatures. It makes sense to take turns doing so. The gang agrees to use a simple rotating order: Hugo, Sawyer, Kate, Jack, Hugo, Sawyer, and so forth. This means that publishing the status paper for day 2 is Sawyer’s responsibility. The paper he publishes reflects Kate’s transfer:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*k1OztwCQK0VCEj2q0lksuw.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>This paper that Sawyer made isn’t final yet because it’s only signed by Sawyer. He needs to collect more signatures. Sawyer goes through the gang and asks each one to verify and sign it. This paper is very easy to verify. First, the verifier needs to look in his own collection of papers and find the status paper that shows the balances for the previous day (day 1 in this case). Next, the verifier needs to go over the new list of transfers. In this case, we only have one transfer by Kate. This transfer is easy to verify, we can make sure it’s indeed signed by Kate and we can make sure Kate indeed has enough coins in her balance to give this amount to Hugo.</p><p  class='text-p'>Once every island inhabitant completes their verification process and signs the paper, Sawyer now has a final status paper for day 2 to publish to everybody. Everybody makes a copy and goes to sleep happy and content.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*Q5eXmxUT_ApsMmryyMW9EQ.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Day 3 is upon us. The system is working well and everybody is excited to spend their coins. Hugo wants to buy some firewood from Sawyer for 10 coins. Sawyer wants to get some pills from Jack for 25 coins and Jack is hungry for a tomato and wants to give Hugo 2 coins to buy one. They each create a piece of paper detailing their transfer:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*ycX4055SkQtlxdWD-8lUbA.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*bctWuCZFNwQQUUujmReiog.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*pp0Wt7y_zErceqjSajZlLQ.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>As evening approaches, the person publishing today’s balances is Kate. To make sure Kate includes these transfers in her paper proposal, they each need to give her a copy of their transfer request. It actually makes sense to give copies to everybody because the person wanting to perform a transfer doesn’t necessarily remember whose turn it is to publish today’s update.</p><p  class='text-p'>Jack lingers with getting the copy of his transfer request to Kate and by the time he brings it to her, her balance status of the day is already written:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*tBS7xHCuxj_23NZyHt-oBA.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Jack is frustrated that this balance status doesn’t include his own transfer. This means Hugo won’t receive Jack’s payment for the tomato, and won’t give Jack the tomato for dinner. Jack is going to go to sleep hungry tonight. He storms out to look for something else to eat and doesn’t sign Kate’s paper proposal for the day. Luckily, Kate is able to get enough signatures from the rest of the gang:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*ZmnafqZRmDwnG2zoymt17g.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Kate managed to get 3 signatures on the paper, each verifying that the balances indeed match the transfers and yesterday’s balances. We have a majority, so this status sheet is considered final.</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s day 4 and nobody knows where Jack is. He went fishing the night before, got caught out in a storm and didn’t return to camp. It might be problematic because it’s Jack’s turn today to publish the balance update.</p><p  class='text-p'>Kate wants to make a couple of transfers today, she writes them on a piece of paper and gives a copy to everybody:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*teHs2E8mXwau6ES-h0rwXw.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Evening approaches and Jack isn’t back yet. The gang had previously agreed that it’s his turn to publish the balances, but he’s nowhere to be found, so this day’s balance update is skipped.</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s day 5, and Hugo is the one responsible for publishing the daily update. It’s been raining for a few days and Hugo wants a warmer place to sleep. He asks Sawyer to build him a small wooden hut. Sawyer wants 200 coins for the job. It’s a bit of a problem because Hugo only has 98 coins. Hugo has a crazy idea though, he is the one publishing the balance sheet today, so why not add a crazy transfer of this amount to Sawyer anyways?</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*qP6qC5W3o5Cb5G5L6c9Hlg.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>There are no other transfers today. Hugo has Kate’s transfers from yesterday though, and Jack’s transfer from the day before that didn’t make it in eventually. He adds all of those, together with his new crazy transfer:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*J6AZfUSvAvINSQtWHy1Zpw.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Hugo signs this update although his transfer doesn’t really make sense. To make this status update final, he needs to collect 2 more signatures. When he approaches Sawyer and Kate, they notice that on the previous final balance sheet (from day 3), Hugo had 92 coins. How can he send 200 to Sawyer? They refuse to sign this balance sheet until he fixes this error and removes this invalid transfer. He reluctantly agrees and publishes a new balance sheet which is correct. They eventually sign it:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/how-to-run-a-blockchain-on-a-deserted-island-with-pen-and-paper/1*U405dZX7lZmgSicmn8-EFA.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>This balance update is final because it has 3 signatures.</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s the morning of day 6. Jack finally comes back to camp. He had a rough couple of days with the storm and all. He wasn’t part of the discussions in the last two days and missed announcements of new transfers and publications of new balance updates. He’s actually unsure how many coins he has. He finds the first fellow survivor he sees and asks for the latest updates he missed. He is given the final update for day 5 and the approved update Kate that published on day 3.</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s easy for Jack to synchronize back with the rest of the gang. He can see that these balance updates were indeed signed at least 3 times, so he can be relatively safe that they’re ok. He can also perform the calculations himself based on these updates and the latest update he has (from day 2). This will allow Jack to participate in today’s transfers just like he didn’t miss anything.</p><p  class='text-p'>The system seems to be working well. It’s true that it’s a bit simplistic, but it’s enough for what these island inhabitants need. Well, we can’t have a functioning blockchain without a white paper! The gang sits down and celebrates the accomplishment by publishing this magnificent one:</p><p  class='text-p'>Why is this considered a blockchain? For starters, each piece of paper published daily represents a <em>block</em>. Each block is numbered and points to the previous one — forming a chain of blocks. In order to verify the current state of balances, any observer must start from the beginning of the chain (day 1 — the <em>genesis block</em>) and verify each of the blocks one after the other in succession. The balances are built incrementally.</p><p  class='text-p'>Is this an ideal blockchain implementation? Probably not. It can be improved in many ways. For example, it only supports these 4 inhabitants. What happens if another survivor crashes on the island? Will this protocol be able to accommodate them? This protocol is also currently <em>permissioned</em>, how can we turn it to be <em>permissionless</em>?

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
