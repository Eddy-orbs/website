Travel and tourism industries have been particularly crippled by the virus, with no near term end in sight. Also concerning is the understanding that this will probably not be the last time that a global pandemic will affect all aspects of life for the world’s population. There is, or there should be, an internalization that if the world is to remain open, it needs to be prepared. Some kind of systematic solution is needed that will assist the global community to live through a pandemic without a mass closing of borders.</p><p  class='text-p'>Many countries are struggling to adapt, and even those that have succeeded in curtailing the disease have solutions that are far from optimal. Testing each individual upon arrival is labor-intensive and expensive. On the other hand, allowing people in without a test, relying only on “green countries/zones”, or accepting test results that are practically impossible to validate might incentivize adverse selection and have severe consequences in further spreading the disease.</p><p  class='text-p'>We need a solution for the future, and the key to that solution is blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>Blockchain is most effective when multiple parties need to work together, but do not want one party to control the database; instead, they want shared control and visibility, combined with immutability. So the use case of a global (in our case COVID, but in the future for all other pandemics) passport that would connect to each country’s network of verified medical labs and confirm either immunity or test results, is almost self-explanatory in it’s blockchain use case. This solution would allow multiple local governments, whether states, regions, or cantons, to coordinate amongst themselves with or without the support of a federal or central government. In many instances, local coordination can be far more efficient, productive and effective than waiting for a central government to get its act together. By way of example, in the US, multiple governors could coordinate their health efforts or travel restrictions in order to control flow into their jurisdictions. Similarly, in the EU, member states could use the system to control or stem the flow of visitors into “green zones&#39;&#39;. Another benefit is that medical institutions could easily share data on testing methodologies, best practices or any other type of information as part of the global effort to fight the pandemic.</p><p  class='text-p'>Of course, a system like this would need to address important challenges. For one, user privacy is paramount. Individuals will need to share test results while minimizing access to all other personal data among the parties involved. Second, test authenticity will need to be proved. And finally, based on the above, destination countries will need an instrument that will allow them to set a coherent policy for allowing visitors to cross their borders.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs has been discussing this vision for utilization in an EU member country. We proposed a platform that will consist of two permissionless blockchain databases that are constantly interacting with each other and a mobile app:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Trust Registry</strong> - a registry of all medical institutions (hospitals, labs, etc.) that conduct COVID-19 tests (the <strong>“Testers”</strong>). In addition, it will be denoted which health organizations endorse the Tester, if any. This is where the innovation stems from, as this registry would provide an up-to-date metric for the Tester’s credibility. The endorsement will be carried out using digital signatures, and most importantly, they would be open for the public. Each country could determine and publish its criteria for a Tester to be deemed credible, for instance, endorsed by the World Health Organization, or by at least two Ministries of Health, etc. This information would be useful for passengers, knowing in advance whether their latest test results are valid for entering a specific country.</li>
<li><strong>Certificate Registry</strong> - an <strong><em>anonymized</em></strong> registry of all the tests conducted, including all the information necessary to evaluate their reliability, including: Tester ID (taken from the Trust Registry’s), date, test method, batch number, etc. The only piece of information that is excluded would be the individual’s identity. Thus, a unidirectional connection will be established, allowing an individual to prove that she is the subject of a particular test, but never the other way around.</li>
<li>The mobile app will tie all loose ends, being the <strong><em>only</em></strong> connection between an individual and a test result.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Upon reaching the passport control post, the individual will present her digitally signed test results over the app. The results will be verified online to make sure that the results are authentic (properly notarized on the Certificate Registry), reliable (conducted by a reliable Tester), and valid (a combination of the previous two along with the individual’s ID).</p><p  class='text-p'>Blockchain provides the following benefits for:</p><ul>
<li>The hosting country - reliable, cheap and swift solution for immediately verifying an individual’s medical condition, based on its own prerequisites</li>
<li>The individual - maximized privacy, given that only the border control is involved in validating the results, without having to contact the Tester</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/blockchain-based-health-immunity-passport/Screen-Shot-2020-09-13-at-13.57.39-1030x356.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Naturally, both registries are constantly being updated. In the Trust Registry new testers apply for registration or existing testers are being endorsed (or revoked).  In the Certificate Registry, Tester status is being updated as Testers notarize new test results. Cities, states, regions or countries using this system will have a seamless, transparent and continuously updated database that will allow them to keep their borders open for those who are verified as disease-free, and thus their economy functioning - in a healthier manner.</p><p  class='text-p'>It is time for a wake-up call and for global coordination and preparation. SARS, MERS, Ebola provided past warnings of what was to come - but COVID-19 took us all to another level. What is to say that the next global pandemic will not be even worse? Given the increasing importance of business travel and tourism to the global economy, we can not remain unprepared. On a technological level, it is time to up the universal game and work together to make sure that we are not torn apart.</p><p  class='text-p'>For more information please contact Netta Korin (<a href="../mailto:netta@hexa.org" rel="noopener">netta@hexa.org</a>)</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><em>© All Rights Reserved to Hexa Foundation Ltd.

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves.

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
