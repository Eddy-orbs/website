On the other hand, these COVID19 precautions make for unusual schedules for team members who are used to attending large events and meetups which have slowed down to a complete halt in the foreseeable future. In Orbs Tel Aviv headquarters, we have taken measures including private transportation and orders to work from home, as well as daily updates and guidelines from the state and abroad regarding the news. Sit tight!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-update-march-2020/orbs-wfh-gallery.png" alt="Orbs WFH meeting, yesterday"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>We have already been conducting meetings from home, and so far, so good. There’s a strong sense of unity which is expected during bizarre times like this, and the comradery among Orbs members is no exception!</p><p  class='text-p'>It appears we are all in this together, even from behind closed doors. Let’s have a look at some of the more uplifting things from this past month or so:</p><h1 id="orbs-around-the-world"  class='title-h1 title'

<h3 id="u-s-israel-joint-fintech-dialogue"  class='title-h3'
    >U.S.-Israel Joint Fintech Dialogue</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by Ran Hammer</em></p><p  class='text-p'>On Feb 26th, Netta and I had an opportunity to participate and present at the first-ever U.S.-Israel Joint Fintech Dialogue. This was the first time the US has ever held such an event with any other country!</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Participants</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>From the US government side: Acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Mitchell A. Silk, Advisor Aryeh Lightstone from the State Department and other high ranking officials from the US Treasury and State Department.</p><p  class='text-p'>From Israeli government side:  Deputy Minister Yitzhak Cohen, Chief Economist Shira Greenberg, Ilanit Madmoni, Director of Financial Innovation Unit and Bank of Israel, Elhanan Harmor, Director of License, Supervision Unit and the ISA, Shlomit Wagman, Director General of Israeli AML Authority and other high ranking participants.</p><p  class='text-p'>From the private sector -  Representatives from companies like Bank Leumi, Visa, MasterCard, AWS, Citi Group, KPMG, law firms etc.</p><p  class='text-p'>Fortunately, Orbs got to be the most predominant participant from the private sector, presented our views on the proposed regulation to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Alternative Data (yes we have those), and also got to promote several blockchain topics in the ensuing discussions. For instance, companies like MasterCard, Visa, AWS, Leumi Bank, PayBox, etc., did not have a slot to present and some didn’t even get a seat at the table, so it really is a great privilege to have been part of it.</p><h3 id="orbs-hosting-the-us-treasury"  class='title-h3'
    >Orbs Hosting the US Treasury</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The following day (Feb 27th), we had the honor to host the Treasury delegation, including the Acting Assistant Secretary, at Orbs offices. Participants on our side were Netta, Sharon Shalom, Oded N, Mattan, Nate and myself.</p><p  class='text-p'>We presented Orbs, the core team, technology, and offers. We also had a chance to discuss potential use cases, with an emphasis on the public sector and social impact. The Assistant Secretary and staff were very receiving and seemed enthusiastic about our offering for the public sector.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Assistant Secretary suggested we meet with different agencies within the administration to see how we can collaborate, with a few specific ideas already discussed during the meeting, and actually suggested to help us with scheduling the meetings. Super exciting stuff!</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://twitter.com/orbs\_network/status/1233097906607005696" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://twitter.com/orbs\_network/status/1233097906607005696</a></p><h3 id="blockchain-workshop-with-vision-fund-"  class='title-h3'

<p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gogogili" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@gogogili</a></em></p><p  class='text-p'>We’ve had an amazing day with <a href="https://twitter.com/SoftBank" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@SoftBank</a>’s investment arm, AKA Vision Fund, a 100 billion dollar fund and one of the most influential hi-tech funds in the world. We spent the day with a diverse group, coming from different teams within the fund (operation, investment, legal, finance, etc). We highlighted the fundamentals of blockchain technology and the core value derived from it, and gave an overview on Orbs’ unique approach to the market and how we designed the technology stack to accomodate for real-world businesses to be using blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>Lastly, we elaborated on 4 different, practical use cases. We were also happy to bring with us the brilliant <a href="https://haseebq.com/about/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Haseeb Qureshi</a>, a managing partner at DragonFly Capital crypto fund to give an overview on DeFi.</p><h3 id="4th-stanford-blockchain-conference-2020"  class='title-h3'
    >4th Stanford Blockchain Conference 2020</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://twitter.com/Dannyhbrown" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@Dannyhbrown</a> and myself attended the Stanford Blockchain Conference as part of our ongoing engagement with the Silicon Valley blockchain community. During the conference, we were kept updated on some of the biggest projects (Libra included), caught up with partners and presented Orbs to media outlets and other stakeholders.</p><h3 id="hyperledger-conference"  class='title-h3'
    >HyperLedger Conference</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Earlier this month, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dannyhbrown" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@Dannyhbrown</a> attended the HyperLedger Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. Due to the COV fears, attendance was much lower than expected, but the conference team had organized some great small-team workshops, having participants work on use-cases using different methodologies to identity value and design architecture.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://twitter.com/Dannyhbrown" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@Dannyhbrown</a>&#39;s team worked on a supply-chain use-case with unique market conditions: the market for Caviar is being overwhelmed with fake and illegally grown merchandise, while authorities in producing countries are not trusted to provide authentication certificates. In addition to the supply-chain architecture, provenance and external quality auditing, the proposed solution also included ‘out of the box’ ideas of user-generated content and reviews - thus highlighting further the benefits of public blockchains.</p><h3 id="world-economic-forum-wef-knowledge-tools-preview-and-discussion"  class='title-h3'
    >World Economic Forum (WEF) Knowledge Tools Preview and Discussion</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs, as a WEF Global Innovator, was asked by the Centre for The Fourth Industrial Revolution to participate in their beta testing for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16vVIzxprzw" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Strategic Intelligence</a> Platform. In a day of overview and product testing, we had the pleasure to contribute from our knowledge and experience on how this platform can best serve members of the WEF.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-update-march-2020/PngItem_1531291.png" alt=""></figure>Earlier in March, we submitted our response to the World’s Bank Invitation for Prototype Build for Traceability of loan disbursements (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/corporate-procurement/business-opportunities/administrative-procurement/exploring-blockchain-for-traceability-of-world-bank-loan-disbursements" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>IPB 20-0801</a>). We provided a full conceptual blockchain-based solution for tracking and tracing funds. This solution allows any government, financial aid organization or other financial institutions to monitor and manage budgets on a per-project basis down to the last mile payment. This kind of solution can revolutionize financial resources efficiency by providing maximal transparency to decision makers, and preventing multiple fraud attempts.  Following our initial submission we have been informed that Orbs has passed the mandatory criteria and are invited to conduct a demo to propose our solution. The demo is scheduled for later this month.</p><h3 id="presentation-to-the-israeli-government-s-crypto-currencies-task-force"  class='title-h3'
    >Presentation to the Israeli Government’s Crypto-currencies Task Force</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://community.orbs.network/u/assaf_bielski/summary" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@assaf_bielski</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ran-hammer-32323278/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@RanH</a> presented to the special crypto-currency regulatory task force formed by the Bank of Israel, with participation of treasury, tax and securities regulators. The objective of the task force is to create a regulatory environment that will accommodate the growth of the blockchain and crypto industries, and it is now on a learning tour with the leading blockchain companies in Israel. We presented the huge potential of blockchain and the value it can bring to government services and the industry in general. Ran reviewed the obstacles and challenges that blockchain infrastructure present to regulators due to its decentralized network. The participants were very impressed and were particularly interested in some of the government use cases, which we hope to develop together later this year.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h1 id="wallet-news"  class='title-h1 title'

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
