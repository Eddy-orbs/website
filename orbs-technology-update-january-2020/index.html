    ><em>Intro</em> <em>by</em> <a href="https://github.com/OdedWx" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@OdedWx</em></a></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Since the last tech update there has been progress on multiple fronts. The network continues to progress with new applications joining and improvements are developed. The PoS ecosystem is active and a 3rd round of reward distribution was successfully completed. Improvements to the PoS architecture are in research along with work on integrating a staking contract. And new monitoring tools are being developed to provide a better environment to application developers and plays in the PoS ecosystem.</p><p  class='text-p'>3 weeks ago an update to the network core code was deployed by the validators. Before deploying it on application’s virtual chains that are in production, the node code was deployed on a virtual chain used as a &quot;canary in the coal mine&quot; that doesn’t hold any critical assets or data. Even though the code was heavily tested including by Marvin - an innovative automated blockchain test environment - and on private networks, the deployment on the canary chain initially failed. Following a fast debug by the core team and several validators the root cause was identified and fixed. Due to Orbs virtual chains isolation architecture, the fail had no impact on any application virtual chain which later successfully deployed a fixed code (v1.3.6). The use of test methodologies has proven itself as a strong tool to maintain the applications’ stability while allowing upgrades and progress.</p><p  class='text-p'>Based on the experience with Orbs PoS ecosystem and as a next step and as part of the work on the staking contract architecture, research activities are taking place to identify improvements to the PoS architecture. The research examines the different roles in the network, the requirements from each one and incentives and rewards used to drive their honest behaviour. An additional interesting aspect of the architecture is the relationship between Orbs and Ethereum. Orbs PoS architecture enjoys the objective auditing by Ethereum, as part of improvements to the architecture changes in the logic division between the two blockchains is being investigated.</p><p  class='text-p'>The technical engagement team successfully helped two new virtual chains to onboard the network. Linet (<a href="https://validate.linet.org.il/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://validate.linet.org.il/</a>) on virtual chain 1970000 and Open Rights (<a href="https://open-rights.org" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://open-rights.org</a>) on virtual chain 1960000. Linet is a receipts notarization application leveraging Orbs public blockchain to provide proofs of in immutable and in-time generation of client receipts.  Open rights is an open database for registered users’ content allowing them to protect their IP. Application fees have been distributed to Validators through the vchain subscription process.</p><p  class='text-p'>As part of the process to make the network more friendly to applications, contributors and all PoS ecosystem players, new monitoring tools are being developed. A new monitoring tool that provides a view of the entire network status is currently under development. Once ready it will provide the players and in particular the Guardians with means to monitor the network health and validators’ operation.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-blockchain-core-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

<p  class='text-p'>This monthly update is more descriptive in nature, as most of the core team was (and still is) engaged as part of thePoS Architecture  Team, described below. In addition, significant effort was made to put Marvin (the testnet&#39;s testing framework) to first use. Also, a bugfix effort on v1.3.5 is described.</p><h3 id="-strong-v1-3-5-deployment-downtime-incident-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>v1.3.5 deployment downtime incident</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>On December 16th, virtual chain (VC) 5110 on mainnet was upgraded to v1.3.5. This VC is operated by Orbs Ltd. and is a pre-production VC that helps identify last-minute issues before upgrading the production VCs. Upon upgrade, the VC immediately stopped closing blocks. Most of the core contributor team stepped into an intensive research mode.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another VC was started to confirm that failure to close blocks is not specific to that specific vVC, and indeed the new VC did not close blocks either.</p><p  class='text-p'>Additional research uncovered the following:</p><ul>
<li>VC 5110 was running against an old list of validators. One of the validators had changed its Orbs address a while back, but the network topology (as defined in Boyar) the other validators used, still had the old address. This meant Gossip messages sent to that specific Validator could not reach it.</li>
<li>An update to Lean Helix algo that was introduced on v1.3.5 changed the behavior of sending messages through Gossip to a specific list of Validators, rather than to all validators indiscriminately (the motivation was to cut redundant consensus traffic between nodes). Furthermore, a Validator would try sending a message to a list of Validators in a loop and if one the send operations failed, the loop would be cut short instead of skipping to the next Validator - this a previously undetected bug.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Following these discoveries, the bug in Gossip code was fixed and deployed to the above VCs as v1.3.6, and was confirmed to fix the issue - the network resumed closing blocks. Of course the address of that specific Validator was also updated, but the important thing was the network was made more resilient as a result of fixing this bug.</p><p  class='text-p'>It took 2-3 hours to identify the root causes - this was a prime example of synergy between different  members and contributors, as all involved shared their knowledge of the system and quickly reached the correct root cause, then promptly had it fixed and deployed.</p><p  class='text-p'>Thanks to using the pre-production VC at no time was any actual production VC involved in this - these were upgraded directly to v.1.3.6 after the bug was fixed.</p><p  class='text-p'>Involved team members: <a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a>, <a href="https://github.com/vistra" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@vistra</em></a>, <em><a href="https://github.com/gadcl" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@gadcl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OdedWx" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@OdedWx</a>,</em> <a href="https://github.com/netoneko" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@netoneko</em></a><em>, <a href="https://github.com/andr444" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@andr444</a>,</em> <a href="https://github.com/jlevison" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@jlevison</em></a></p><h3 id="-strong-marvin-strong-strong-strong-strong-flow-complete-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Marvin</strong> <strong>—</strong> <strong>Flow complete!</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>There was significant progress by @IdoZilberberg and <a href="https://github.com/itamararjuan" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@itamararjuan</em></a> with running automated tests on PRs and when merging code into master branch. The CI workflow of <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>orbs-network-go</a> repo will very soon run an endurance test and compare its results against previous runs on the master branch, and against tolerable performance thresholds. If the test fails, the new version is not released to Docker hub. In case this is a new PR being pushed, the developer is notified of the test results via Slack and Github.</p><p  class='text-p'>The logic of &quot;judging&quot; whether the test passed or failed is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Dredd" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Dredd</a>, and is part of <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/marvin" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>orbs-network/marvin</a> repo and also published to npm as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbs-network/judge-dredd" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@orbs-network/judge-dredd</a> so modifying it does not require rebuilding orbs-network-go.</p><h3 id="-strong-pos-architecture-enhancements-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>PoS Architecture Enhancements</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs PoS Universe has been active for more than 9 months already. We’ve been working to learn from the PoS architecture and identify areas that may be improved towards a sustainable architecture. A multidisciplinary team that includes both researchers and core developers has been working to research the subject and propose potential architecture improvements. The work focused on three aspects: the Ethereum - Orbs architecture, integration of the staking contract and investigation of potential improvements to PoS model.</p><p  class='text-p'>The team reviewed and analyzed data of past elections and reward distribution. In addition, they reviewed the models and tools of other PoS projects trying to learn from their strong and weak points. As part of the research activity, the team has also started to collect inputs from players in the ecosystem.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs platform implements a PoS over PoW architecture, in which the ORBS token, delegation and voting operate over  Ethereum. The use of Ethereum as an objective platform for the PoS architecture provides an objective mechanism for the Orbs elections and incentive layer. The use of an external and objective platform prevents a scenario where the ones being elected are the ones monitoring their honest operation. In the current PoS architecture, the PoS delegations and votes are performed on Ethereum while the election calculations are performed on Orbs.</p><p  class='text-p'>While looking into the boundaries between Orbs and Ethereum, the team has made an interesting observation in the tradeoff between liveness and consistency. In a distributed system there’s an inherent tradeoff between liveness and consistency and when designing a system architects need to favor one of them and try to maximize the other, relying on the incentive layer. For enterprise applications, finality and consistency appear to have the highest priority. An architecture where the elections are performed and calculated on Ethereum but on each state change, the currently elected set inaugurates the new one on Orbs seems to optimize both auditability on Ethereum and consistency due to a clear view of the elected set on Orbs.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another interesting aspect in the Ethereum - Orbs architecture is the potential to reduce the Ethereum requirements to a light client. The team has been working on an architecture changes to allow both auditability, relying on past events and a light client architecture without a need to maintain past state.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-technology-engagement-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

My years of experience as a donor and as an advisor in the Israeli government helped fuel within me the desire to fix a system that is clearly broken on a global level. It is common, and in fact, silently acceptable, that international aid funds go astray, and, in our neighborhood, even funding terror instead of providing much-needed humanitarian aid.</p><p  class='text-p'>Recently I <a href="../tracking-gaza-terror-funding" rel="noopener">discussed</a> how blockchain technology can be used to track humanitarian aid to Gaza in order to prevent aid dollars from reaching terrorist organizations. . The largest single provider of international aid funds to Gaza over the last decade has been Qatar. In this piece I would like to detail their giving, and show how, combined with our solution, we could potentially create a mechanism that will alter the way in which international institutions distribute aid, and create transparency and accountability.</p><p  class='text-p'>Some background: Since 2008, Israel and Hamas have had three armed conflicts, the most recent of which was in May 2021. With Israel’s consent, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/.premium-with-israel-s-consent-qatar-gave-gaza-1-billion-since-2012-1.6917856" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Qatar provided Gaza with over $1 Billion from 2012 to 2018.</a> Within a few weeks of the end of the last conflict, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-families-begin-receiving-qatari-aid-payments/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Qatari fund flow was renewed</a>, again with Israel’s consent. However, history has shown that over <a href="../tracking-gaza-terror-funding" rel="noopener">$1.25 Billion of funds</a> have sadly been siphoned to Hamas for terror financing, and thus did not achieve the humanitarian purpose. This is tragic for many reasons, but also because of the fact that 80% of Gazans rely on these aid funds. Therefore, it should be of global interest to optimize the distribution procedure and make it as smooth, secure and transparent – as possible. Smooth, in order to avoid any friction involved with waiting hours in lines, verifying that there are no duplicate distributions, etc. Secure, in order to make sure that funds are provided to the people and do not end up in Hamas hands. Transparent, in order to provide accountability to the funders and perhaps even encourage more giving. img</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/qatari-aid-and-cbdc-can-change-international-giving/img1.jpeg" alt="img"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Palestinians receive their financial aid, 100 USD per needy family offered by Qatar, at a post office in Gaza City on June 27, 2020. (Photo by MAHMUD HAMS / AFP)</em></p><p  class='text-p'>It is estimated that over <a href="https://www.fmo.nl/news-detail/9fc7842f-3e08-4390-96e5-73cd9a06d215/reaching-the-unbanked-in-the-palestinian-territories" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>50% of the adult population</a> in Gaza is unbanked. Consequently, it is not surprising that the current funds distribution mechanism is very rudimentary – Gazans stand in line to receive $100 per family. No doubt that it is neither smooth nor secure, and I would also argue questionably transparent.</p><p  class='text-p'>Technology and innovation can significantly improve the process. We can now create an efficient mechanism to distribute aid funds and satisfy all three of the above-discussed requirements.</p><p  class='text-p'>The platform would utilize the Orbs funds track and trace solution, deployed with CBDC, and would work as follows:</p><ul>
<li>The Bank of Israel delegates Palestinian banks to open digital accounts to Gaza citizens. This procedure involves a standard KYC to verify recipients’ identity and eligibility for aid. The accounts will be operated using a mobile application. Naturally, in order for the funds to have a proper use, business places and service providers in Gaza will also require digital wallets. They will undergo the same KYC procedure.</li>
<li>The funds from Qatar are wired to the Bank of Israel by a wire transfer, rather than cash. Upon their receipt they will be converted into Digital Shekels and transferred to a designated bank account, operated by a third party humanitarian organization who will supervise or control the process, similar to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-agrees-to-take-over-distribution-of-qatari-funds-in-gaza-report/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>the role of the UN in the most recent distribution.</a></li>
<li>From the designated account the funds are transferred directly to Gazans’ digital accounts, i.e. <strong>directly to their mobile devices.</strong></li>
<li>All the wire transfers are fully tracked and accessible to relevant parties only, in order to assure that the entire amount was properly distributed to the people in Gaza</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Clearly, there are significant benefits to using this platform instead of continuing with cash distributions:</p><ul>
<li>Once users are onboarded to the platform and their new digital wallets are up and running, the distribution can be fully automated. Meaning that they do not have to stand hours in line for aid funds, and that paperwork becomes redundant. The platform provides a full, detailed and immutable report of the distributions. It is then available for the inspection of all relevant parties, <strong>online and in real-time.</strong></li>
<li>Onboarding users should be fast and simple as the recipients of aid funds are already known to the aid systems, and have undergone onboarding procedures to verify they are entitled to these funds. In addition, as most, if not all, of them already have a smart mobile device, opening the digital wallet would just require downloading the application and providing their credentials</li>
<li>Proper KYC would make it very hard for terror-related parties to get their hands on these funds. Rigorous KYC should prevent them from opening digital wallets, thus depriving them of access to the platform. Moreover, in case they do manage to somehow get a hold of digital wallets, these addresses can be blacklisted and blocked for future use. Furthermore, chain analysis features would assist in tracking the sources of the aid funds gone rogue, to fight future attempts of exploiting aid funds. As a result, it would be easier to make sure that the funds reach their rightful destinations.</li>
<li>Migration to digital wallets will spur financial innovation in Gaza, as <strong>it will de-facto bank the unbankables.</strong> These wallets will provide many Gazans with access to financial services never before accessible, e.g. saving accounts, insurance, pension funds and more. This can potentially be the most significant step towards their financial well-being, and is an additional benefit that should not be <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">overlooked</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Of course, like every system, this one has its challenges. As is the case with any CBDC platform, user privacy is an issue. The ledger is immutable, meaning that all transactions are documented forever. Even if the platform is not public and permissionless, it still means that authorized parties will have full access to aid funds recipients’ transaction history. One may rightfully argue that this is a severe infringement of their privacy. I tend to agree to a certain extent, with two objections. The first is that this so-called infringement is inherent to CBDC platforms in general, not necessarily Orbs funds track and trace solution. By the way, there are already several suggestions to tackle this type of privacy challenges. Second, as I have repeated several times while discussing this topic, the enemy of the good is the perfect. A functioning and practical system that satisfies core requirements in an area of conflict and terror can never be a perfect solution. Currently, the international community is <a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/sen-risch-wont-lift-hold-on-palestinian-aid-without-guarantee-taxpayer-money-is-kept-from-terrorists/amp/?__twitter_impression=true" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>underfunding Gaza</a> due to the justifiable concern that Hamas will use the monies to support terror activities. Would it not be better to instead deploy a solution now that would profoundly impact Gazans’ financial well-being, and improve user privacy in future versions?</p><p  class='text-p'>The situation in Gaza is dire. If Hamas continues to utilize aid funds to construct tunnels and purchase military equipment, the cycle of violence will continue, and even as Gaza is rebuilt – it will only be temporary until the next conflict. However, if Hamas does not have access to aid funds due to a transparent and efficient system that truly directs funds towards citizens and not to a terrorist organization, then perhaps we can create a respite from the conflict. A lot needs to happen before the lives of the people in Gaza improve. For decades, international communities have reached out in an attempt to assist, only to see their funds go astray. It is time for accountability and for transparency. Using a CBDC based track and trace solution is a clear step forward that would ameliorate the situation, strengthen the financial independence of innocent civilians, and ensure donor countries that their monies are being used for good instead of evil.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
