As the investigation unfolds, reports of images and videos of the crime surface. Sadly, this type of crime and the documentation of it, occurs in every country. Survivors of sexual violence face even more emotional damage due to the existence of digital imagery of the crime that took place. Videos and photos are forwarded and posted on instant messaging and social media, and often cloud platforms are helpless (or choose not) to do anything to stop this.</p><p  class='text-p'>Until now.</p><p  class='text-p'>I will preempt by saying that there will always be bad people in the world who will find a way of doing bad things, and posting illegal and illicit images of children on the darknet. I am aware that at the moment at least, nothing can be done to stop them, technologically. I do know however that the technology exists to assist popular cloud storage platforms in removing ALL of those illegal images from their databases, and that - morally - it should be our mission to help them do so.</p><p  class='text-p'>The technology is called blockchain. A decentralized and encrypted database created by multiple law enforcement agencies by each sharing their proprietary databases, can allow cloud platforms to scan and tag their images while being uploaded, in order to locate and delete child pornography that has been confirmed as illegal. In addition, it would allow them to scan and tag this type of content that is <em>already</em> stored and distributed across their platforms.</p><p  class='text-p'>There are few ‘no brainer’ cases for blockchain. In fact many use cases would be better served using a centralized as opposed to a decentralized solution. However, when multiple parties who have a trust issue need to work together and want visibility on their work - blockchain is the obvious answer. I believe that we have the perfect use case here.</p><p  class='text-p'>Multiple law enforcement agencies from around the world each have databases of illegal child sexual imagery. However, cloud platforms are not too keen to have law enforcement or government interfere with their client’s private caches, nor do enforcement agencies have a global reach. Distributing or viewing this imagery is illegal - to the point that even if a victim&#39;s family scans the internet to see if images still exist, they can be charged with illegal conduct for doing so. So how do we create a situation where multiple law enforcement agencies, locally or globally, can collaborate on a database of illegal images for cloud platforms to easily and efficiently access and remove all traces of child sexual exploitation material - but without actually having access to the material itself? The answer is with the combination of PhotoDNA and blockchain.</p><p  class='text-p'>PhotoDNA is a technology developed by Microsoft and Dartmouth College to create a unique digital fingerprint of a digital image (or a video for that matter). Thus, any set of images may be analyzed and compared in order to determine their similarity. This means that even if an image was manipulated (e.g., cropped, resized, filters applied, etc.) it can still be <em>automatically</em> identified as a variation of another image that looks different, but has the identical (or similar enough) digital fingerprint.</p><p  class='text-p'>As impressive as this may be, it is blockchain that takes this solution to the next level, as it allows law enforcement agencies from around the world to easily and efficiently collaborate. While some of them have databases of illegal imagery, it seems that they don’t share them with each other, at least not as often as one would expect them to. This is exactly where blockchain shines by providing the platform for building a distributed shared database that everyone equally owns. Put differently, it would be a joint global effort in which each law enforcement agency shares the fingerprints it has collected and in return, gets full access to all the other fingerprints that other agencies have. However, no single agency is “in charge” or “owns” this database. They all equally do. Once it is up, they can easily upload new digital fingerprints, and of course benefit from the ones that other agencies have.</p><p  class='text-p'>Once the database is up and running, cloud storage platforms will get read-only access to it and could immediately start scanning and tagging illegal imagery, based on this globally confirmed set of digital fingerprints. Moreover, they would be expected to do so for each file that is uploaded from now on. Furthermore, each enforcement agency could determine the set of rules that cloud storage platforms would be required to adhere to in their jurisdiction, making the platforms’ lives easier in that aspect.</p><p  class='text-p'>It is worthwhile emphasizing that it is not a database of <em>images</em> but of <em>digital fingerprints</em>. Without getting into technical details, the connection is unidirectional, <em>i.e.</em> it is easy to generate a fingerprint from an image, but impossible to reverse-engineer the image from a fingerprint. Therefore, a fingerprint by itself is meaningless and cannot be traced back to an image. This results in a database that aside from being highly secured by nature, being blockchain-based, provides no incentives to be hacked by someone who’s looking to own or distribute illegal content, and also removes the concern of sharing the actual material which is illicit or illegal in nature.</p><p  class='text-p'>The chart below shows the process in the eyes of a user who’s trying to upload an image to his cloud storage drive.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/blockchain-against-child-abusive-imagery/blockchain-imagery-732x1030.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Finally, to top it all, the entire process will be <em>completely transparent</em>. Meaning that enforcement agencies can see which fingerprints were added by who, cloud platforms will know exactly which fingerprints they need to screen in which jurisdictions and enforcement agencies could easily check whether their restrictions are properly enforced by cloud platforms. Perhaps, that should be the main catalyst for using blockchain for this use case.</p><p  class='text-p'>Sadly, as of now there is no perfect solution that will eliminate the problem of child sexual imagery from the internet. Evil people always find a way of doing evil things, and they will go to dark places of the internet to do so. But we can - easily - remove these images for the majority of users who do not have the technological expertise to access the darknet.  The Hexa Foundation is in talks with both government and enforcement agencies exploring the opportunity of using the Orbs blockchain as a solution that will help cloud platforms remove these images from the view of the everyday internet user. As the saying goes, the enemy of the good is the perfect. We can not take away the crime, but we can help remove hurtful and haunting documentation of it from surfacing. We actually can, today, make a dent in this horror, and so we should rally behind our law enforcement and our social media service providers - and help them do so.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="hexa-foundation"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
