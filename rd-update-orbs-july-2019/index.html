    ><strong>Highlights</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by</em> <a href="https://github.com/OdedWx" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@OdedWx</em></a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://github.com/talkol" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@talkol</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>Hi community, this has been a busy month since the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-rd-update-june-2019/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>last R&amp;D update</a>!</p><p  class='text-p'>The biggest thing happening was the first ever rewards distribution. As you know, the rewards are given and accounted for on an ongoing basis (on every election), but the tokens themselves are distributed over Ethereum in bulk after 3 months. We’ve had our first successful distribution which included the first 27 election periods (1 through 27)!</p><p  class='text-p'>Some statistics: 18,018,788 ORBS were distributed to 1,448 addresses. The distribution took place by a <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5627766a3f55354a2cd70f9153a2bebe1053d2f5c99aec647027ce85e93b3f1b" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>smart contract on Ethereum</a>, to make sure we have a third party external verification of the entire process. There’s a very nice architecture that requires only a single transaction with commitments for the entire distribution event. Following the commitment transaction, any account may send the distribution transactions relying on the commitments. This means that the process is transparent and easy to review and also very efficient (50 distributions per transaction). <a href="https://www.orbs.com/first-orbs-rewards-distribution-summary/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>See this post describing the entire process</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another area the contributors have been focusing on this month is production network fixes. The network is up in production since March, and is constantly monitored for issues and improvements. For example, the lean helix threading model was improved, preventing corner cases that may cause a delay in a block creation. Another example is improvements to the gossip threading model.</p><p  class='text-p'>There’s a lot of excitement in the community for working with the system and making this process easy for developers. One very exciting project I want to point out is the Orbs Playground - an online IDE for smart contract developers that lets them experiment and develop smart contracts on Orbs directly from their web browser - without downloading and installing any tools! This very cool tool started as a hackathon project, but got such a good feedback that it became a standalone project that is now actively maintained. Also look forward to seeing it embedded more in more in the various Orbs websites.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-blockchain-core-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

Presently, the algorithm suffers from less-than-ideal performance when the rate of incoming transactions is low, due to having a single goroutine for waiting for new transactions, and for handling external events such as Node Sync and Leader Election in Lean Helix. Following several proof-of-concept iterations, a new model was decided upon, and development is underway! This work is expected to complete during July, more details will be available in the next update (stay tuned).</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a> completed an update of the Gossip goroutine threading model in <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1211" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PR1121</a>. Before this change, DirectTransport had a goroutine per connection, and handling a message occurred on that goroutine. This effectively blocked further communication from that peer for the duration it takes to handle the message. Some Gossip consumers, such as the LeanHelix consensus algo, may block for a long time, if - for instance - it is waiting for a new block to be produced.</p><p  class='text-p'>This PR creates a goroutine per Gossip topic, writing from the connection goroutines to the topic goroutines via a buffered channel. Essentially this serializes all messages from <em>all peers</em> to a single goroutine, but frees the connection goroutines to handle subsequent messages, and guarantees QoS per topic.</p><p  class='text-p'>In addition, the code now creates a one-off goroutine per Block Sync request, so that scanning blocks or reading chunks from disk will not block the Block Sync topic goroutine. Another PR, <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1193" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1193</a>, upgrades the Orbs platform to compile using Golang 1.12.6 (previously 1.11.x was used).</p><p  class='text-p'>It is expected that the Lean Helix topic will not be blocked, as it will have a goroutine that deals with reading from the topic.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/noambergIL" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@noambergIL</em></a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a> updated code in <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/lean-helix-go/pull/49" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PR49</a>, <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1202" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PR1202</a> to support <em>Sign()</em> becoming an external service - to that end, a cancellable Go context was added as a parameter to this method.</p><p  class='text-p'>More PRs by <a href="https://github.com/noambergIL" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@noambergIL</em></a>:</p><ul>

<p  class='text-p'>There are multiple application use cases being developed across the community these days (that I’m aware of). These projects will be elaborated upon in dedicated blog posts as they mature, so here we’ll provide some basic descriptions and details:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'>A POC with a leading academic institution regarding blockchain-based music rights management - this is a well-known pain in the industry, and we believe our Orbs-based solution can provide a valuable service. The developed POS combines on-chain rights registry with off-chain indexing and storage.</p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>A collection of use-cases with a media distributor to create a blockchain-based content registry (photos, videos etc.) and enable search, collaboration and monetization. Some interesting use-cases include:</p><ul>
<li>Smart contracts to register and search for registered images - including a perceptual hash search that finds images similar to provided ones</li>
<li>Chrome extension - to highlight registered images in a browser and retrieve their metadata</li>
<li>Webcrawler - retrieve metadata for all images on a webpage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p  class='text-p'>Document notarization - we’ve further developed the document notarization use-case, introducing encrypted fields, ownership and more. These concepts have been presented to multiple parties interested in blockchain-based document registration and notarization (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/notary" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/notary</a>).</p></li>

    ><strong>Research and Architecture</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by</em> <a href="https://github.com/avilanthe1" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@Avilanthe1</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ research efforts continue with researchers and developers work on different aspects of the Orbs blockchain infrastructure! Here is a breakdown:</p><h3 id="pos-research"  class='title-h3'
    >PoS Research</h3>
<h5 id="-strong-market-research-strong-"  class='title-h5'
    ><strong>Market research</strong></h5>
<p  class='text-p'>Resources are dedicated to researching the PoS market. There are two sides to this market: Projects, and ecosystem players. On the projects’ side, Orbs researchers have been focused on learning ~20 different projects which have a PoS element to them. In particular, they’ve been trying to understand what goals were the projects trying to realize via specific design choices, and how ecosystem players eventually chose to respond. On the ecosystem players side, mapping the market to different types of players — staking services, infrastructure services, lending platforms, exchanges, etc to how each type may benefit/harm a PoS network.</p><h5 id="-strong-open-and-competitive-validators-nomination-process-strong-"  class='title-h5'
    ><strong>Open and competitive validators nomination process</strong>.</h5>
<p  class='text-p'>Currently, Validators undergo a due diligence process in order to evaluate their technical abilities and enabling gradual rollout. Orbs architects are working on an architecture that enables to remove the need for due diligence and enables an open and competitive process. This competition, as a by-product, should increase the security of the network and its usability.</p><p  class='text-p'>As a first step to achieve this, we are working on a locking contract for Validators and Validator candidates. This locking contract, deployed on Ethereum, is designed to match the Orbs election architecture and support efficient queries by the election contract that runs on top of the Orbs platform. In order to allow the protocol to evolve in the future, they&#39;ve designed the contract to be migratable, while still requiring participants to provide their agreement for the migration.</p><h3 id="threshold-bls-signature-scheme-security-proof"  class='title-h3'
    >Threshold BLS signature scheme security proof</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>An ongoing <em>Random Beacon</em> project is carried out by members of the research team. In this work, a set of rational players jointly perform a multiparty computation that results in a random number, that can be used in diverse applications. One such notable application is the selection of random committees in Orbs’ consensus mechanism.</p><p  class='text-p'>A cryptographic primitive that naturally appears in this context, is ‘<em>threshold digital signature’</em>; the set of participants sign messages in an incorruptible manner as long as a large portion of them is honest. One manifestation of a threshold digital signature builds upon the well-known (single player) BLS signature scheme. However, security proof of the threshold version of this scheme is not covered in the literature. More specifically, the question raised is whether the devised scheme indeed holds the threshold property, meaning that a (certain specific) portion of players cannot produce a valid signature, while larger sets of players can. Orbs’ Research team has prepared a mathematical proof of security to ensure the security of the threshold version of the BLS signature scheme.</p><h3 id="zero-knowledge"  class='title-h3'
    >Zero-Knowledge</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs core contributors continue to explore the subject of privacy through zero-knowledge proofs, focusing primarily on a few subjects:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Trusted Setup.</strong> Most efficient forms of zero-knowledge proofs require a <em>trusted setup,</em> a subject of controversy, as it entails an expensive procedure and is specified to an application. In other words, different applications (including updates to an application) require different trusted setups. We study zero-knowledge proof systems where the trusted setup only has to be carried out once and is universal in the sense that it supports all applications. These usually come at a price of efficiency, and we focus on mitigating this problem, taking advantage of the efficiency of the Orbs blockchain infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Key generation ceremony.</strong> The generation of keys is a process ideally performed by a trusted party, as leakage of the private keys has severe implications. However, In typical blockchain usually, such a party does not exist. Our team has been studying the procedure to ensure that keys do not leak while avoiding the need for a trusted third party.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="file-systems-and-immutable-large-data-storage"  class='title-h3'
    >File Systems and Immutable Large Data Storage</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs Network aims for accommodating apps that (among others) require large amounts of storage. After all, how would you run a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-total-size-storage-capacity-of-YouTube-and-at-what-rate-is-it-increasing-How-is-Google-keeping-up-with-the-increasing-demands-of-Youtube%E2%80%99s-capacity-given-that-thousands-of-videos-are-uploaded-every-day" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>distributed YouTube</a> if storage is limited? One direction the research team has taken to explore immutable storage for large data.</p><p  class='text-p'>Part of the research included the reviewing of the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) protocol. IPFS is a distributed peer to peer storage system that has recently gained a lot of interest from various blockchain projects that see IPFS as a good candidate for their protocol’s storage layer (like TrueBit).</p><p  class='text-p'>The research team has been scrutinizing the different components of IPFS in order to learn from them towards a solution tailored particularly for the purpose of the Orbs blockchain infrastructure.</p><p  class='text-p'>Among these components are Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) for fast content lookup and peer locating the network; GIT protocol for version control; block exchange protocol for data swapping marketplace - all may be relevant for the future design of the ever-evolving Orbs infrastructure.</p><p  class='text-p'>A prominent piece that is missing in the original design of IPFS is the incentive layer. When considering distributed storage solutions at scale, with recurrent data reads and writes, there must be an incentive layer that allows nodes to withstand their costs. The FileCoin protocol is designed to complement exactly that. The research team has recently focused on one of FileCoin’s most interesting innovations: Proof-of-Replication (PoRep). PoRep provides an entity with a way to prove that a specific number of replications of a particular file are stored in her local storage system. A distributed file system protocol that is able to absorb the overhead PoRep incurs can solve the problem of data availability, which is one of the major issues when dealing with vast amounts of storage.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Thanks for reading!</strong> I hope this recurring monthly segment is educational and does a great job informing Orbs followers on the R&amp;D happenings.

<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues.

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
