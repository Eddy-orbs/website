On one hand, we were all in a bit of euphoria after the successful launch of our production layer, while at the same time productivity really kicked into overdrive. In this post, I want to involve our followers with happenings at Orbs on all fronts from events to tech. First things first:</p><h2 id="-strong-the-big-korea-launch-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>THE BIG Korea Launch</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>After a year of activity in Korea, Orbs team has hit some important and impressive milestones of brand awareness, a strong community, and engagement with major enterprises:</p><h3 id="-strong-enterprise-event-with-the-israeli-economic-mission-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Enterprise Event with the Israeli Economic Mission</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The event on April 3rd targeted Korean enterprises in several industries: More than 30 corporate representatives attended the private event to hear Orbs Co-founder Uriel Peled&#39;s talk. Following the event, Orbs team has held a number of 1:1 meetings with those who’ve requested it, including:</p><ul>
<li>Enterprise telcos</li>
<li>Automotive companies</li>
<li>Prominent blockchain companies</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-strong-deconomy-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Deconomy</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>April 4th: Orbs’ booth and VIP room were incredibly busy, and Uriel Peled’s keynote speech was very well received. Check out the slides from the event here:</p><iframe src='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSSWf97wTyUbjPFGRYgDE9Y-wZTwrQlpmqEAWLJoYXOD1im3LJDtr8YYci-_28A8iSyBlFn0MQ73EMl/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000'></iframe>

<p  class='text-p'>Orbs team has been exploring use-cases and tech with key members of the industry. Gili has a lot of follow-ups to take care of! Some of the highlights from the Korea meetup: [embedyt] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2htLz\_st78\[/embedyt\]" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2htLz\_st78\[/embedyt\]</a></p><p  class='text-p'>Later, Uriel gave an excellent interview to TokenPost, the full version of which you can watch below: [embedyt]<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxJ-sL0AtZY\[/embedyt\]" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxJ-sL0AtZY\[/embedyt\]</a> Our Korean readers may want to check out the <a href="https://www.tokenpost.kr/article-8071" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>full TokenPost article</a>. Overall, this was arguably our greatest Korean event, with enormous lines and lots of fruitful meetings. Thank you, everyone, and especially our AMAZING Korean community and team!</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-other-events-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Other events</strong></h2>
<h3 id="-strong-orbs-launch-tel-aviv-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>ORBS Launch Tel Aviv</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>After months of meeting and working with everyone in the universe, we finally needed some “us” time. So, a week after the launch of our network, we held a private party here at our HQ office in Tel Aviv on April 3rd. Speeches, toasts, food drinks and dancing with family and friends were just what the doctor ordered for us to come back to work at full blast.</p><h3 id="-strong-noah-conference-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>NOAH Conference</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The European NOAH conference came to Tel Aviv, and Orbs was a key speaker in the field of enterprise blockchain technology. The event hosted 2,000 technology CEOs, executives and investors seeking to establish new business relationships and gain early insights into the latest proven tech concepts. Orbs was represented on the big stage by our technological Co-founder Tal Kol, who presented a crystal-clear vision of blockchain&#39;s competitive, open-source future. The short 10-minute speech can be viewed in the embedded video below. If you’re a latecomer and want to understand the full scope of what we are working on, without too much technical jargon -- THIS is the speech to listen to: [embedyt] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4btt3F4o70\[/embedyt\]" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4btt3F4o70\[/embedyt\]</a></p><h3 id="-strong-dealmakers-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Dealmakers</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In <a href="https://www.orbs.com/april-update/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>last month’s update</a>, I&#39;ve mentioned Orbs being a featured partner at the Israel Dealmakers Summit in San Francisco. For those who are wondering what it was like presenting to representatives from the likes of Nasdaq, Microsoft and other high-caliber industry leaders, you can now watch Orbs Head of Partnerships <a href="https://twitter.com/Dannyhbrown" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Danny Brown Wolf</a> predict the future of enterprise blockchain in the video released last week: [embedyt] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diuVDVBhVq8\[/embedyt\]" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diuVDVBhVq8\[/embedyt\]</a></p><p  class='text-p'>We also took part in a panel discussing trends in fintech and held a great conversation about the role of blockchain in the future of the financial world. In addition to Gili Ovadia, Orbs also hosted the following panelists:</p><ul>
<li>Oshri Kaplan, Investment Director – Munich Re Ventures</li>
<li>Ittai Ben-Zeev, Chief Executive Officer – Tel Aviv Stock Exchange</li>
<li>Moderator: Eric Sugar, General Partner and Chief Revenue Officer – Landmark Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-orbs-community-on-discourse-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Orbs Community on Discourse</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Ladies and gents, we have <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-community/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>officially opened the Orbs community discussion board</a>! There has been a lot of internal conversations about the best way to enable project related dialogue to the general public. It is important to us that everyone feels welcome to contribute to this community-driven mission and thank all those participating in the board right now. Ultimately, we found that the open-source Discourse platform was the best way to go about it. Come say hello at <a href="https://community.orbs.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><strong>community.orbs.network</strong></a> (and don’t forget to bookmark☆).</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-in-case-you-ve-missed-it-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

<p  class='text-p'>As fans and regular readers of Hackernoon, we were delighted to discover that the highly influential dev magazine chose to publish Tal Kol’s piece, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-as-the-next-evolutionary-step-of-the-open-source-movement-12ea8d876578" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>Blockchain as the Next Evolutionary Step of the Open Source Movement</em></a>, on its front page! <figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-update-may-2019/image3.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>At the end of the month, Tal <a href="https://twitter.com/orbs_network/status/1123249385754722309" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>was featured AGAIN</a> on the front page of Hackernoon with another article, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-blockchain-dichotomy-and-an-architecture-to-overcome-it-d2f75582bab4" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>The Blockchain Dichotomy and an Architecture to Overcome It</em></a>.

    ><strong>Open Source Initiative has an eye on Orbs</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>If that wasn’t neat enough, the Hackernoon post was then retweeted by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to its some 35k followers. We are die-hard fans of the work done by OSI, so needless to say that getting noticed by this wonderful organization is very flattering.</p><p  class='text-p'>The motivation is clear. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/opensource?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#opensource</a> is good for humanity.

As a global non-profit, the OSI champions software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the Open Source Definition (OSD), and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethos inherent to the open source movement.</em> Considering that Orbs has gone fully open-source only a month ago, having already garnered the attention of a firebrand organization like OSI is something everyone here is extremely proud of. We are excited about the possibility of collaborating with a corporation like this, whose work has been a major inspiration to the Orbs project.</p><h3 id="-strong-codc-blockchain-trade-mission-to-israel-strong-"  class='title-h3'

<p  class='text-p'>Orbs has been singled out by The Chamber of Digital Commerce and the U.S. Department of Commerce Commercial Service as an example of what blockchain innovation in Israel is all about!

<p  class='text-p'>This month is Tal’s month, apparently! The daily Hebrew business newspaper TheMarker (by Haaretz) interviewed our Co-founder for a monthly special publication on all things blockchain. Israel has been at the forefront of blockchain development for a couple of years now, so being chosen by one of its leading magazines to represent the booming industry is no small feat.

    ><strong>Other expansion highlights</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by Assaf Bielski</em></p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs has been exploring use cases with an industry consortium within the global telecom space, with the aim of developing a shared future blockchain infrastructure onto which multiple blockchain applications would be deployed. Their primary challenge, right now, is guaranteeing trust in the platform even when the consortium grows to hundreds and even thousands of members, not all of whom partake as nodes in the system. Orbs can solve this challenge through its hybrid consensus model, which offers a new trust model for consortia by separating block production from validation offering entirely.</p><p  class='text-p'>Whenever we see opportunities where Orbs is a great fit, it’s important to educate and familiarize these businesses with the project in hopes of them becoming active members of the ecosystem. There’s also lots of work being done on a detailed proposition for a digital identity solution architected on top of Orbs, an area blockchain is widely expected to revolutionize. For the first time, people will be able to control their identity which can be verified through a decentralized network, without any organization holding their data.</p><p  class='text-p'>A major global consumer electronics manufacturer and several IT companies are involved in defining the requirements for such a solution on top of Orbs, and closing in on the first markets to test it. Most production blockchain identity solutions used by enterprises today rely on private blockchains. We see significant value in introducing a public blockchain solution, which addresses additional problems like identity theft.</p><p  class='text-p'>Along with those long-term projects in the community, it’s important to identify “quick wins”; areas in which public blockchain can be used by businesses today, so the project can start engaging with the market and showcase the value of blockchain. One such area of interest is “document notarization” - a simple way for companies to register documents on the blockchain so that their authenticity can be verified at any time. This SDK  is currently in the definition phase. The exciting part about it is how easy it will be to integrate: Most blockchain integration projects for enterprises require a dedicated systems integrator, and are usually both costly ($100K plus) and lengthy (months). This SDK, however, can drop this cost to nil and the time to just several days.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>We are preparing for Consensus 2019</strong>, where Orbs team members will attend and meet companies from different industries to discuss the Orbs project, as well as an educational roadshow in India during which we are scheduled to meet blockchain experts from global technology service providers to discuss potential partnerships within the Orbs ecosystem.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="tech-highlights"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

My years of experience as a donor and as an advisor in the Israeli government helped fuel within me the desire to fix a system that is clearly broken on a global level. It is common, and in fact, silently acceptable, that international aid funds go astray, and, in our neighborhood, even funding terror instead of providing much-needed humanitarian aid.</p><p  class='text-p'>Recently I <a href="../tracking-gaza-terror-funding" rel="noopener">discussed</a> how blockchain technology can be used to track humanitarian aid to Gaza in order to prevent aid dollars from reaching terrorist organizations. . The largest single provider of international aid funds to Gaza over the last decade has been Qatar. In this piece I would like to detail their giving, and show how, combined with our solution, we could potentially create a mechanism that will alter the way in which international institutions distribute aid, and create transparency and accountability.</p><p  class='text-p'>Some background: Since 2008, Israel and Hamas have had three armed conflicts, the most recent of which was in May 2021. With Israel’s consent, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/.premium-with-israel-s-consent-qatar-gave-gaza-1-billion-since-2012-1.6917856" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Qatar provided Gaza with over $1 Billion from 2012 to 2018.</a> Within a few weeks of the end of the last conflict, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-families-begin-receiving-qatari-aid-payments/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Qatari fund flow was renewed</a>, again with Israel’s consent. However, history has shown that over <a href="../tracking-gaza-terror-funding" rel="noopener">$1.25 Billion of funds</a> have sadly been siphoned to Hamas for terror financing, and thus did not achieve the humanitarian purpose. This is tragic for many reasons, but also because of the fact that 80% of Gazans rely on these aid funds. Therefore, it should be of global interest to optimize the distribution procedure and make it as smooth, secure and transparent – as possible. Smooth, in order to avoid any friction involved with waiting hours in lines, verifying that there are no duplicate distributions, etc. Secure, in order to make sure that funds are provided to the people and do not end up in Hamas hands. Transparent, in order to provide accountability to the funders and perhaps even encourage more giving. img</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/qatari-aid-and-cbdc-can-change-international-giving/img1.jpeg" alt="img"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Palestinians receive their financial aid, 100 USD per needy family offered by Qatar, at a post office in Gaza City on June 27, 2020. (Photo by MAHMUD HAMS / AFP)</em></p><p  class='text-p'>It is estimated that over <a href="https://www.fmo.nl/news-detail/9fc7842f-3e08-4390-96e5-73cd9a06d215/reaching-the-unbanked-in-the-palestinian-territories" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>50% of the adult population</a> in Gaza is unbanked. Consequently, it is not surprising that the current funds distribution mechanism is very rudimentary – Gazans stand in line to receive $100 per family. No doubt that it is neither smooth nor secure, and I would also argue questionably transparent.</p><p  class='text-p'>Technology and innovation can significantly improve the process. We can now create an efficient mechanism to distribute aid funds and satisfy all three of the above-discussed requirements.</p><p  class='text-p'>The platform would utilize the Orbs funds track and trace solution, deployed with CBDC, and would work as follows:</p><ul>
<li>The Bank of Israel delegates Palestinian banks to open digital accounts to Gaza citizens. This procedure involves a standard KYC to verify recipients’ identity and eligibility for aid. The accounts will be operated using a mobile application. Naturally, in order for the funds to have a proper use, business places and service providers in Gaza will also require digital wallets. They will undergo the same KYC procedure.</li>
<li>The funds from Qatar are wired to the Bank of Israel by a wire transfer, rather than cash. Upon their receipt they will be converted into Digital Shekels and transferred to a designated bank account, operated by a third party humanitarian organization who will supervise or control the process, similar to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-agrees-to-take-over-distribution-of-qatari-funds-in-gaza-report/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>the role of the UN in the most recent distribution.</a></li>
<li>From the designated account the funds are transferred directly to Gazans’ digital accounts, i.e. <strong>directly to their mobile devices.</strong></li>
<li>All the wire transfers are fully tracked and accessible to relevant parties only, in order to assure that the entire amount was properly distributed to the people in Gaza</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Clearly, there are significant benefits to using this platform instead of continuing with cash distributions:</p><ul>
<li>Once users are onboarded to the platform and their new digital wallets are up and running, the distribution can be fully automated. Meaning that they do not have to stand hours in line for aid funds, and that paperwork becomes redundant. The platform provides a full, detailed and immutable report of the distributions. It is then available for the inspection of all relevant parties, <strong>online and in real-time.</strong></li>
<li>Onboarding users should be fast and simple as the recipients of aid funds are already known to the aid systems, and have undergone onboarding procedures to verify they are entitled to these funds. In addition, as most, if not all, of them already have a smart mobile device, opening the digital wallet would just require downloading the application and providing their credentials</li>
<li>Proper KYC would make it very hard for terror-related parties to get their hands on these funds. Rigorous KYC should prevent them from opening digital wallets, thus depriving them of access to the platform. Moreover, in case they do manage to somehow get a hold of digital wallets, these addresses can be blacklisted and blocked for future use. Furthermore, chain analysis features would assist in tracking the sources of the aid funds gone rogue, to fight future attempts of exploiting aid funds. As a result, it would be easier to make sure that the funds reach their rightful destinations.</li>
<li>Migration to digital wallets will spur financial innovation in Gaza, as <strong>it will de-facto bank the unbankables.</strong> These wallets will provide many Gazans with access to financial services never before accessible, e.g. saving accounts, insurance, pension funds and more. This can potentially be the most significant step towards their financial well-being, and is an additional benefit that should not be <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">overlooked</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Of course, like every system, this one has its challenges. As is the case with any CBDC platform, user privacy is an issue. The ledger is immutable, meaning that all transactions are documented forever. Even if the platform is not public and permissionless, it still means that authorized parties will have full access to aid funds recipients’ transaction history. One may rightfully argue that this is a severe infringement of their privacy. I tend to agree to a certain extent, with two objections. The first is that this so-called infringement is inherent to CBDC platforms in general, not necessarily Orbs funds track and trace solution. By the way, there are already several suggestions to tackle this type of privacy challenges. Second, as I have repeated several times while discussing this topic, the enemy of the good is the perfect. A functioning and practical system that satisfies core requirements in an area of conflict and terror can never be a perfect solution. Currently, the international community is <a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/sen-risch-wont-lift-hold-on-palestinian-aid-without-guarantee-taxpayer-money-is-kept-from-terrorists/amp/?__twitter_impression=true" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>underfunding Gaza</a> due to the justifiable concern that Hamas will use the monies to support terror activities. Would it not be better to instead deploy a solution now that would profoundly impact Gazans’ financial well-being, and improve user privacy in future versions?</p><p  class='text-p'>The situation in Gaza is dire. If Hamas continues to utilize aid funds to construct tunnels and purchase military equipment, the cycle of violence will continue, and even as Gaza is rebuilt – it will only be temporary until the next conflict. However, if Hamas does not have access to aid funds due to a transparent and efficient system that truly directs funds towards citizens and not to a terrorist organization, then perhaps we can create a respite from the conflict. A lot needs to happen before the lives of the people in Gaza improve. For decades, international communities have reached out in an attempt to assist, only to see their funds go astray. It is time for accountability and for transparency. Using a CBDC based track and trace solution is a clear step forward that would ameliorate the situation, strengthen the financial independence of innocent civilians, and ensure donor countries that
