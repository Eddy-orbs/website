    >Classic double-sided farming through vaults</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The concept of DeFi vaults was popularized by <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Andre Cronje</a> under <a href="https://yearn.finance/vaults" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>yearn.finance</a> and was an instant hit with the DeFi community. The idea is simple — allow multiple farmers to supply liquidity together and manage the position automatically through smart contracts in order to increase yield efficiency with actions like compounding (taking the daily rewards, selling them back to the base liquidity assets and increasing the position to generate compound interest).</p><p  class='text-p'>A notable vault project that followed is <a href="https://harvest.finance/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>harvest.finance</a> which expanded on the idea with a holistic token economy. Harvest’s staking token <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/harvest-finance" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>FARM</a> captures 30% of the farming profits as a fee, but is also used to incentivize more farmers to participate by distributing it in addition to the underlying yield to increase total APY.</p><p  class='text-p'>Aggregated yield farming vault products have become very popular on BSC as well, with notable projects like <a href="https://acryptos.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>acryptos</a> and <a href="https://autofarm.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>autofarm.network</a> — the leader of the pack with over $1.5 billion of mind-boggling TVL at the time of writing.</p><p  class='text-p'>So what does a classic double-sided vault look like? Let’s take one that is farming ETH/USDC liquidity rewards on Uniswap/SushiSwap/1inch:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-3/1_3UFPBgNSAyhMr9_rkrqrdA-1030x434.png" alt=""></figure></p><ol>
<li>DeFi (<em>Type A</em>) player deposits ETH and USDC in the vault contract — harvest.finance for example. Often, vaults prefer users to technically deposit LP tokens directly but the two are interchangeable.</li>
<li>The vault contract deposits the ETH/USDC in the DEX pair contract — <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x397ff1542f962076d0bfe58ea045ffa2d347aca0" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SushiSwap</a> for example, in return for LP tokens.</li>
<li>LP tokens are deposited in the LP farming rewards contract — Sushi’s <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2edad668740f1aa35e4d8f227fb8e17dca888cd" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Masterchef</a> for example, and start earning SUSHI rewards.</li>
<li>Periodically, the vault claims the SUSHI rewards, sells them for ETH/USDC and cycles back to step 2.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="single-sided-farming-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Single sided-farming via Orbs Liquidity Nexus</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The idea we’ve been building towards in this series of posts is single-sided farming. One of the potential methods to introduce this concept to relevant target audiences is through a vault. Since vaults cater to <em>Type A</em> participants (see previous posts for definition), the vault will only represent one of the sides — the ETH side.</p><p  class='text-p'>The other side, USDC in our example, is provided by <em>Type B</em> participants. Since they’re not frequent travelers in DeFi space, we can rely on the Liquidity Nexus protocol to bridge them in.</p><p  class='text-p'>What would that look like?</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-3/1_fu-3x-EspMc46G2XFGsBcg-1030x466.png" alt=""></figure></p><ol>
<li>DeFi (<em>Type A</em>) player deposits ETH in the vault contract. This would have to be a new vault of course, taking ETH only, contributed to one of the existing vault projects like harvest.finance and accepted by its governance.</li>
<li>CeFi (<em>Type B</em>) player deposits USDC through the Liquidity Nexus protocol into the Nexus contract. This piece of the puzzle makes single-sided farming possible and implements the logic discussed in the previous post.</li>
<li>The ETH vault contract pairs newly deposited ETH with available USDC waiting in the Nexus contract. This pair of ETH/USDC in equal value is deposited by the Nexus contract in the DEX pair contract — <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x397ff1542f962076d0bfe58ea045ffa2d347aca0" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SushiSwap</a> for example, in return for LP tokens.</li>
<li>LP tokens are deposited in the LP farming rewards contract — Sushi’s <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2edad668740f1aa35e4d8f227fb8e17dca888cd" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Masterchef</a> for example, and start earning SUSHI rewards.</li>
<li>Periodically, the ETH vault claims the SUSHI rewards through the Nexus contract, sells them for ETH and cycles back to step 3.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="eth-only-vaults-are-rare-and-desirable"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >ETH-only vaults are rare and desirable</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>If you have experience with DeFi, you probably know that ETH-only strategies are not common. Even when they’re found, they usually offer low APYs. This is the current ETH-only strategy on harvest.finance:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-3/1_FQvFQmvCa_JM7SP_qKfJiA-1030x447.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>As you can see, the internal APY of the vault is quite low — only 0.41% (the rest is FARM rewards incentive to participate). The straightforward strategy employed by this vault is supplying the ETH as collateral to <a href="https://compound.finance/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Compound</a>, and earning both the supply interest and the COMP rewards. This also explains why the APY is relatively low, lending ETH doesn’t pay very much.</p><p  class='text-p'>Using the Liquidity Nexus protocol, we can develop a new type of ETH-only strategy that generates much higher APY. The APY should be even higher than double-sided farming of ETH/USDC on Sushi. Why? Because our single-sided tokenomics favor the ETH side in rewards and give it more than half, in exchange for taking more of the IL risk — see the previous post if this point is unclear.</p><p  class='text-p'>This result is quite attractive for existing vault projects like harvest.finance since chasing the highest APY for their users is exactly their bread and butter.</p><p  class='text-p'>The result is also quite attractive for the <em>Type A</em> DeFi players, because the strategy is single-sided and requires a core crypto asset they normally hold a lot of (ETH) — without the annoying balancing act of acquiring USDC in equal value.</p><p  class='text-p'>And last but not least, the result is also quite attractive for the <em>Type B</em> CeFi players, because the strategy from their side requires USDC only and minimizes exposure to crypto volatility — while providing APY that is significantly higher than normally received in CeFi.</p><h2 id="applicable-for-any-dex"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Applicable for any DEX</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Another advantage of this approach is that it requires zero changes to the underlying DEX. The method supports the existing versions of Uniswap, SushiSwap, 1inch, PancakeSwap and many others right out of the box.</p><h2 id="implementation"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Implementation</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Now that we have a clear architecture in mind, it’s time to dive into the implementation. We are going to implement the yellow section of the above diagram — the Liquidity Nexus contract.</p><p  class='text-p'>As the <a href="https://rekt.news/leaderboard/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>rekt leaderboard</a> has taught us, vaults are delicate and subject to nuance. Successful vaults can manage millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars in value, making them prime targets for manipulation.</p><p  class='text-p'>From our experience, exploits can roughly be divided to 2 types:</p><ul>
<li>Economic attacks — Issues that stem from logical problems regardless of which language the code is implemented in. One example that comes to mind is the notorious use of a flash loan to <a href="https://rekt.news/harvest-finance-rekt/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>steal $25M</a> from the USDC and USDT vaults of harvest.finance.</li>
<li>Implementation attacks — Issues that stem from implementation nuances of the virtual machine or compiler of the specific language used to write the contracts. Most contracts are written in Solidity, which comes with a wide range of <a href="https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>known attacks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>It seems that the first type is the more successful as of late, which leads us to believe that many implementations often overlook the economics and jump into the bits and bytes a tad too quickly. To counter, let’s dedicate the first phase of our implementation to a pure economic simulation.</p><h2 id="phase-1-economic-simulation"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Phase 1 — economic simulation</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The Github repo is available here: <a href="https://github.com/defi-org-code/single-playground" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/defi-org-code/single-playground</a></p><p  class='text-p'>What makes a successful simulation? First of all — rapid prototyping. Writing a simulation should be easier and faster than writing the real thing. Since we want to focus on logic alone, we can choose any language. It wouldn’t make much sense to rely on a strict and safe language like Solidity because its defensive nature makes development too slow. We need a language that cares less about the details and will let us focus on the big picture instead.</p><p  class='text-p'>JavaScript comes to mind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The second challenge of a simulation is modeling the world around us. Since we’ll be implementing the yellow section of the above diagram — the Liquidity Nexus contract — we need to mock everything else. This sounds like a complicated task but it really isn’t. Let’s take Sushi for example. There’s no need to accurately implement Sushi in all its glory, a rough behavior will do.</p><p  class='text-p'>Consider this short and sweet simulated version of Sushi — <a href="https://github.com/defi-org-code/single-playground/blob/master/sushi.js" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>sushi.js</a></p><p  class='text-p'>The power of a simulation comes from giving the developer convenient tools to experiment with various attacks. We’ve already mentioned flash loans as something to be careful of. But what would an attacker use a flash loan for in our case? It could serve as a way to manipulate ETH price for a short while in the Sushi ETH/USDC pool. Instead of spending a few hours modeling a flash loan and everything it entails, let’s take advantage of our simulation and do something much simpler — let’s give our attacker a direct way to <a href="https://github.com/defi-org-code/single-playground/blob/master/sushi.js#L38" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>change ETH price</a>. This will allow us to model attack vectors easily via automated testing.</p><p  class='text-p'>The repo has 3 branches that are interesting to explore:</p><ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/defi-org-code/single-playground/tree/master" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>master</a> — The classic straightforward double-sided vault implementation (control group without any single-sided complexities).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/defi-org-code/single-playground/tree/crazy-idea1" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>crazy-idea1</a> — Single-sided vault based on ERC20-compatible vault shares, where all ETH depositors share IL together. This approach is open to economic exploitation, which is shown in the tests.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/defi-org-code/single-playground/tree/no-shares" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>no-shares</a> — A better single-sided vault implementation that isolates IL between ETH depositors. Does not support ERC20-compatible shares though in a straightforward way (more on this in a future post).</li>
</ol>
<p  class='text-p'>There are multiple interesting things we’ve learned from performing these simulations. I’ll expand on them in a different post though, as they require some background and a lot more detail.</p><h2 id="phase-2-solidity-implementation"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Phase 2 — Solidity implementation</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The Github repo is available here: <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/nexus-sushiswap" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/nexus-sushiswap</a></p><p  class='text-p'>Now, that the economic simulation is complete, the result of phase 1 provides us with a better understanding of the economics and a clear specification for the contract logic.</p><p  class='text-p'>The next phase would be to take this logic and implement it in Solidity. This process is a little slower because you never want to rush Solidity code. This will be the production code that manages significant amounts of money, so a defensive coding style is advised.</p><p  class='text-p'>Integration with the outside world is much easier in this phase since we can use the actual mainnet implementations of all third-party contracts we rely on — like <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x397FF1542f962076d0BFE58eA045FfA2d347ACa0" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SushiSwap ETH/USDC pair</a>. This means we don’t need to mock anything, even for tests.</p><p  class='text-p'>Testing is a little more cumbersome in this phase since we’re testing directly on Ethereum mainnet.

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
