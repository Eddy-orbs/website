I don’t think this realization surprises anyone.</p><p  class='text-p'>What may be surprising to some is that apps are the ones in power in the blockchain infrastructure game. I just recently wrote a blog post about it — <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/who-controls-your-blockchain-5b8bf7ec7f1a" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Who Controls Your Blockchain?</a> — well, now more than ever it’s clear that apps do.</p><h4 id="the-stellar-fork-by-kin"  class='title-h4'
    >The Stellar fork by Kin</h4>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://kinecosystem.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Kin</a> by Kik Interactive is one of the first large-scale consumer apps to transition to blockchain . The main goal for Kin is to create a cryptocurrency (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kin/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>KIN</a>) to be used by millions of end users of digital services like Kik. Kin is a decentralized app that runs on top of a blockchain infrastructure.</p><p  class='text-p'>I’ve had the pleasure of working closely with Kin from its inception, leading blockchain engineering in Kin for the past seven months. Kin needs an immediate term blockchain solution in production in order to meet its business goals to become the mostly used cryptocurrency by consumers. To achieve this, due to the scalability limitations on Ethereum, Kin is launching its digital services ecosystem on the <a href="https://www.stellar.org/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Stellar blockchain</a> instead.</p><p  class='text-p'>So what’s the big news? It was recently announced by the Kin Foundation that this launch is not going to be on Stellar main net — it’s going to be on a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chain-mobile-app-kik-fork-stellar-fee-free-blockchain/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Stellar fork</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Why would Kin do that? Forking a blockchain is difficult. Keeping a blockchain infrastructure in production is a massive undertaking. Securing value by yourself is a big risk and dealing with the scalability issues the consumer world brings is a task that emerging next generation infrastructure projects are just beginning to solve. So why defocus from just creating your app and decide to deal with this complexity yourself?</p><p  class='text-p'>It’s all a question of control. Taking your destiny into your own hands.</p><p  class='text-p'>The immediate reason is that Kin needs to scale quickly and Stellar fees are paid per wallet. If you plan to onboard as many users as possible, a fee model that grows directly with the number of users and is highly susceptible to churn and fraud works against your immediate interests. As stated by Kik’s CEO Ted Livingston:</p><p  class='text-p'><em>“While originally, the team had thought it could just subsidize the transaction fees, they soon realized that it would have to put lumens in people’s wallets to do that. As such, they theorized that bad actors could then just create a bunch of wallets and scrape up the lumens, in an effort to secure enough money to make an impact on the network.”</em></p><p  class='text-p'>The Stellar fork would allow Kin to change the fee model and avoid paying infrastructure fees to Stellar main net nodes altogether.</p><p  class='text-p'>If an app is unhappy with the model a blockchain infrastructure is providing, it will simply abandon it and move to another blockchain, or just fork it — like Kin has decided to do. This is a good example that eventually, the app is in control. And it will take its end-users wherever it goes.</p><h4 id="it-s-much-more-than-fees-it-s-about-governance"  class='title-h4'
    >It’s much more than fees — it’s about governance</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Who controls how high or how low fees are on Stellar main net? This is a classic governance question as the fee model is a core part of the protocol. The Stellar validator nodes are the ones making this decision, they are free to choose whether fees are increased or reduced.</p><p  class='text-p'>In January, validators decided to decrease fees:</p><blockquote>
<p  class='text-p'>Quick Update | Validators on the <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarOrg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@StellarOrg</a> network just voted to lower the base reserve to 0.5 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XLM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#XLM</a> which makes the cost of creating accounts and orders inexpensive again: <a href="https://t.co/2KqKu61aAY"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://t.co/2KqKu61aAY</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#blockchain</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cryptocurrency?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#cryptocurrency</a> — Stellar (@StellarOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarOrg/status/951615519572021248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"title="link" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>January 12, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p  class='text-p'>What prevents the validators from voting on increasing fees tomorrow? Well, nothing theoretically. If higher fees work in their best interest, they are free to increase them to the detriment of the apps running on top.</p><h4 id="what-does-this-mean-for-blockchain-design-"  class='title-h4'
    >What does this mean for blockchain design?</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Making protocol decisions that work against the interest of apps is likely to cause an adoption problem. If the fees you charge for infrastructure are too high — apps will find a cheaper alternative. If you create barriers of entry, like forcing apps to buy stake upfront and be locked-in to a specific project — apps will find an alternative that doesn’t have this lock-in. If the governance model you propose places a different group in control — apps will find an alternative where they’re not stripped of power.</p><p  class='text-p'>This understanding is one of the core principles upon which <a href="https://www.orbs.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs</a> is designed. The Orbs blockchain places apps in control and works together with these apps to make sure the protocol evolves according to their best interest, all while still enjoying the benefits of a completely decentralized environment.</p><p  class='text-p'>Governance on Orbs is performed using a permissionless federation where any app can join and take part in making protocol decisions. The model is built to strip power both from miners who have a hash power advantage over apps and from financial power groups who have more control over stake than apps. Infrastructure fees on Orbs are designed to be the lowest possible, pegged to the actual infrastructure cost. In addition to the use of a subscription model and monthly billing for transactions, this avoids the issue of fluctuating gas costs.</p><h4 id="how-do-blockchain-infrastructure-projects-avoid-forks-"  class='title-h4'
    >How do blockchain infrastructure projects avoid forks?</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Some infrastructure projects create barriers to make forks difficult. A good example is <a href="https://www.hederahashgraph.com/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Hashgraph</a> where patents and intellectual property protections prevent users from forking the protocol. How will this strategy fair with apps? As long as apps will be able to find a parallel solution that provides roughly the same abilities, they are likely to prefer the solution without lock-in.</p><p  class='text-p'>Take a look at the Windows vs. Linux battle for servers and cloud computing. Initially, Microsoft Windows had a performance advantage due to the large corporate funding its development. Ultimately, it was only a matter of time until Linux caught up. The Linux permissive license, freedom of use, open source code base and lack of lock-in ultimately crowned it as the undisputed king of cloud computing.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another popular method of reducing the incentive to fork revolves around security. This is premise of many PoW networks like Bitcoin. The security of the network is directly related to the amount of hash power. Forking the project will not maintain the hash power of the original network, making the more popular fork significantly more secure.</p><p  class='text-p'>This method works well for use cases where Proof of Work is a good fit — store of value for example like Bitcoin. It seems that practically none of the next generation projects aimed for large scale consumer apps is based on PoW. It’s evident that there are other means of securing these networks that are easier to scale. EOS and Stellar, for example, are only running with a couple of dozen of nodes and presumably are secure enough without PoW. Forking these systems will not have a great impact on their degree of security.</p><p  class='text-p'>A different tactic for avoiding infrastructure forks by apps is creating lock-in with methods like placing the infrastructure token in the hands of end users. This is the case with Ethereum for example. For an end user to use an app over Ethereum, they must keep an Ether balance and pay the infrastructure fee directly. If an app wants to migrate away from Ethereum, it will have difficulty to do so because its user base now has a stake in Ether.</p><p  class='text-p'>Creating infrastructure lock-in for apps is a very dangerous approach. The best interest of a consumer app is maintaining its freedom of choice regarding infrastructure. If a better infrastructure solution pops up, the apps that will migrate to it will gain a competitive advantage over those who can’t. In addition, apps are likely to want their user base to adopt their own application token and not the infrastructure’s.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another incentive for avoiding forks is a thriving ecosystem. This is mostly relevant if you’re aiming for professional traders, investors and the secondary market. Take Ethereum’s ERC20 standard, for example. It’s well integrated in exchanges and wallets. Switching an app token to run over a solution that is less integrated in this space will have an impact on liquidity and professional trade.</p><p  class='text-p'>This also appears to make little difference with apps today. Kin has chosen to launch digital services on Stellar although Stellar has a significantly smaller integration ecosystem for secondary tokens. How did Kin avoid the impact on liquidity and professional trade? by running Ethereum and Stellar side by side. It is possible to allow different target audiences of the token (professionals vs. consumers in this case) to rely on different blockchain implementations according to their needs, and switch between implementations seamlessly with technologies like atomic swap. Professional traders aren’t the typcial end users of mass market consumer apps and their needs can be addressed by using Ethereum in parallel.</p><h4 id="so-what-s-the-best-way-to-avoid-forks-"  class='title-h4'
    >So what’s the best way to avoid forks?</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Forking the infrastructure is always going to have a price. Owning the responsibility for maintaining a working blockchain infrastructure environment takes a toll. It requires focus and effort as this isn’t a small task. Security and scalability are issues that entire dedicated projects are focused on. Keeping up with the latest infrastructure technology advancements of this crazy space is even difficult for teams that were formed for this sole purpose. Apps will always have a hard time doing this in parallel to focusing on development of their app itself.</p><p  class='text-p'>Take a look at centralized infrastructure solutions — platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Why don’t centralized apps “fork” them and maintain their own infrastructure data centers? Well, they used to initially, but now it’s actually cheaper not to. An app will always prefer to focus on its core business as long as it doesn’t gain anything significant by doing something else. In the case of AWS for example, cloud providers have become so efficient that delegating the infrastructure task to them makes more business sense. Practically every modern centralized app today, Kik Messenger included, is running on third-party cloud infrastructure.</p><p  class='text-p'>This is exactly the approach we’re taking in Orbs. There is no benefit for apps in forking Orbs. The apps are already in control, they are the ones making governance decisions. They are isolated from one another with virtual chains. The fees are designed to be as low as possible and tied directly to the actual cost of infrastructure. There are no barriers of entry like buying stake upfront and there’s zero lock-in. Orbs is designed to be the most efficient infrastructure solution from an app standpoint, providing an inherent, intelligent sharding system through blockchain virtualization and <em>virtual chains</em>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Even better, there are actually great incentives not to fork. A specialized ecosystem of contributors maintaining the latest version of the protocol and keeping up with the latest infrastructure requirements — issues like privacy and aggressive sharding that next generation solutions are only starting to address. A network that improves its security as more apps join it. The consensus process of Orbs is not limited to a small number of nodes. The Helix consensus algorithm maintains the same level of performance even when the number of nodes increases and more nodes must participate in the consensus process.

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
