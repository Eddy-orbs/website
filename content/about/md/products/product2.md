#### Orbs VM - Decentralized Docker-Based Virtual Machine

Orbs VM provides a dedicated decentralized virtual machine, similar in concept to AWS EC2 - but decentralized. 

Implement your custom service as an industry standard Docker container, without any blockchain specific knowledge. Your container can rely on any programming language you like, such as Go, C++, Rust, JavaScript, Java, Python and more. Deploy your container to Orbs VM and have it executed instantly as an always-on service on dozens of independent validators nodes in a fully decentralized manner.

Orbs VM is not meant to replace your smart contracts. It is a complementary solution that allows developers to enrich their business logic without sacrificing decentralization.
