**Orbs** is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus.
Orbs’ unique features, designed for interoperability with EVM and non-EVM blockchains, together with its decentralized network of nodes, allow it to be set up as a separate decentralized execution layer operating between the base blockchain layer and application layer.

**Orbs** works in conjunction with existing L1 and L2 solutions, such as Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche etc., as part of a tiered blockchain stack. A dApp does not need to move its liquidity onto a different chain in order to utilize Orbs execution services. Orbs acts as a “Decentralized Backend”, enhancing the capabilities of EVM smart contracts and opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs and GameFi.
