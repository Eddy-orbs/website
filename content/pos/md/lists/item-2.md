##### Roles and Responsibilities

- Guardians are responsible for the staking rewards distribution to their community of delegators by being able to modify their Delegator’s rewards split.
- Orbs is a [hybrid blockchain](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-pos-on-ethereum), utilizing Ethereum and Polygon for added security and transparency of the Orbs PoS ecosystem. Orbs Guardians operating on Ethereum are required to run an Ethereum node. As part of V3, Guardians may choose to operate on the Polygon network as well - these Guardians are not required to run an Ethereum node.
- Guardians have an option to be part of the [Certified Committee](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-election-committees) and operate virtual chains that require certified Guardians. Certified Committee members are eligible for added incentives.
- Guardians are expected to be committed to their communities and their Delegators’ staked tokens. Following [OGV-1&2 ](https://www.orbs.com/Proposal-to-Set-Minimum-Self-Delegation/), Guardians are required to have a self-stake of at least 3% of their total delegated stake.

##### Economic Incentives

- Applications running virtual chains on Orbs pay fees directly to the Guardians, representing the cost of the computational resources allocated to the virtual chain.

- Guardians who choose to participate in the Certified Committee receive a bootstrap fund distributed in DAI.
