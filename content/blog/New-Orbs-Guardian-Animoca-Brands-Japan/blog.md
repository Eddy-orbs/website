Based in Hong Kong, Animoca Brands is a global leader in shaping the next generation of the internet, with a strong focus on Web 3.0 strategies. Established to support Japanese intellectual property and content holders—including major publishers, brands, educational institutions, sports organizations, athletes, artists, and game developers—Animoca Brands Japan brings a wealth of expertise and a robust network to our community.

Animoca Brands Japan chose Orbs as their first ever validator partner and offers a partner program to support the global expansion of Japanese Web3 projects and their entry into Japan by providing multifaceted support to promote mass adoption.

### Orbs Guardians: The Backbone of the Orbs Network
As a public, permissionless blockchain infrastructure project, Orbs relies on its Guardians to ensure network security and uphold its long-term vision. Guardians run validator nodes, maintaining the integrity and stability of the Orbs network. The entire Orbs community is excited that Animoca Brands Japan has joined this esteemed group of Guardians, whose dedication and active involvement are vital to the security and operation of the Orbs ecosystem.

### Empowering Orbs Layer 3 Technology

Orbs Guardians are essential to the network’s proof-of-stake mechanism and the innovative Orbs [Layer 3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/). This technology provides DeFi platforms with decentralized backend solutions, offering scalable, efficient, and secure trading capabilities without the need for centralized infrastructure.

Currently, Orbs powers four key protocols:

- [dTWAP](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/) & [dLIMIT](https://www.orbs.com/dlimit/): Advanced trading order solutions
- [Liquidity Hub](https://www.orbs.com/liquidity-hub/): Aggregated liquidity for DEXs
- [Perpetual Hub](https://www.orbs.com/perpetual-hub/): A comprehensive suite for decentralized perpetuals platforms

These protocols deliver CeFi-level execution to DeFi platforms and are integrated with leading projects such as Sushiswap and PancakeSwap. Guardians are crucial in ensuring these protocols operate with robustness, efficiency, and stability.

Orbs welcomes Animoca Brands Japan for joining the Orbs ecosystem and advancing the shared vision of a decentralized future.
