**Exciting news! Lynex, the largest native DEX on Linea and an OG adopter of advanced order types dLIMIT and dTWAP by Orbs, has now adopted the Liquidity Hub standard powered by Orbs L3!**

This strategic integration empowers Lynex traders with access to a broader range of liquidity sources, combining both on-chain and off-chain options for competitive pricing. Powered by Orbs’ advanced L3 technology and available on Linea, the Liquidity Hub offers key benefits like improved execution prices, MEV protection, gasless transactions, enhanced capital efficiency, and a streamlined user interface. This integration significantly enhances Lynex's trading experience, providing traders with greater efficiency and confidence.

Liquidity Hub is a hallmark of innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, conceptualized and built by the Orbs project. It operates on the principles of complete decentralization, open access without permissions, and composability. Thanks to this integration, traders leveraging Lynex on Linea can now tap into the full liquidity potential offered by the network, further expanded by off-chain sources, for better swap prices without incurring any additional costs.

_[Orbs](https://www.orbs.com/) is a decentralized protocol operated by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS. Tens of millions of dollars are staked in TVL. The protocol optimizes on-chain trading with L3 use cases that include aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi._

### How Liquidity Hub Works

Liquidity Hub is a [layer 3 (L3)](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-3s-crypto) infrastructure software powered by Orbs that provides an optimization layer above the AMM. This technology taps external liquidity for better price quotes and lower price impact.

Instead of the typical swap that searches for the best route within the DEX's limited liquidity pools, Liquidity Hub enhances this process by utilizing additional liquidity sources:

1. **On-chain solver auction:** Third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their private inventory.
2. **Decentralized orders via API:** Decentralized orders are accessible using API, enabling institutional/professional traders, such as market makers, to submit bids and compete to fill swaps.

Liquidity Hub allows DEXs to attempt to execute trades without going through the AMM and experiencing price impact. If the layer cannot execute the trade at a better price than the AMM, the transaction will return to the AMM contract and execute as usual.

Therefore, Liquidity Hub can only improve a trader’s experience. If Liquidity Hub isn’t competitive, meaning it would only execute at a worse price for the user or can’t execute at all, the swap will be routed through the AMM contract directly as usual.

### Continuing the Standard 

The Liquidity Hub protocol, powered by Orbs [L3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/), has become the industry standard for achieving the best price possible without leaving DEX, a win-win for both projects and end users.

The protocol has been implemented into six protocols, including Quickswap on Polygon PoS and zkEVM, Thena on BNB Chain, IntentX on Base, and Spooky on Fantom. Lynex is the sixth project to adopt the standard.
