**QuickSwap, the largest native DEX on Polygon, is launching an Ethereum liquidity aggregator powered by Orbs Liquidity Hub.**

As a result, Ethereum users can now access some of the deepest on-chain liquidity through QuickSwap. Rather than deploying liquidity pools directly on Ethereum, QuickSwap will leverage Orbs' innovative Liquidity Hub technology. This solution aggregates liquidity from both on- and off-chain sources to deliver highly competitive pricing. The Liquidity Hub achieves this by utilizing a network of solvers, both on-chain and off-chain, that compete to find the most cost-effective liquidity for traders. This includes integrations with platforms like ParaSwap, Odos, and more.

This integration follows a successful [governance proposal](https://x.com/QuickswapDEX/status/1833046666196529439), which approved expanding QuickSwap to Ethereum, leveraging Orbs’ L3 Liquidity Hub Protocol. The QuickSwap dragons are long-time supporters and early adopters of Orbs L3 Protocols such as [dTWAP](https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/) and [dLIMIT](https://www.orbs.com/dlimit/) for advanced trading orders. This integration brings the projects even closer together as both continue to build industry-leading DeFi protocols.

Liquidity Hub stands as a hallmark of innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, conceptualized and built by the Orbs project. It operates on the principles of complete decentralization, open access without permissions, and composability.

[*Orbs*](https://www.orbs.com/) *is a decentralized protocol executed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, staked with tens of millions of dollars in TVL. The protocol optimizes on-chain trading with L3 use cases that include aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives, enabling a DeFi trading experience as efficient as CeFi.*

**How Liquidity Hub Works**

Liquidity Hub is a DeFi infrastructure project that aggregates all of the liquidity in the deployed chain and adds additional sources from off-chain. 

Instead of the typical swap on a DEX, Liquidity Hub instead sources from:

1) **On-chain solver auction:** Third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their own private inventory.

2) **Decentralized orders via API:** Decentralized orders are accessible using API, enabling institutional/professional traders, such as market makers, to submit bids and compete to fill swaps.

**Continuing the Standard**

The Liquidity Hub protocol, powered by [Orbs L3 technology](https://www.orbs.com/overview/), has become the industry standard for achieving the best price across ecosystems. 

To date, the protocol has been implemented in seven separate venues, each on a different chain. QuickSwap on ETH will join as the 8th integration. Headliners include Quickswap on Polygon, THENA, Lynex, IntentX, Fenix, among others.

**About QuickSwap**

QuickSwap was designed to address the issues of high gas fees and slow transactions found in other decentralized exchanges, especially on Ethereum. Launched in October 2021, QuickSwap leverages the Polygon network’s Layer 2 scaling solutions to offer users faster and cheaper transactions.

Notable blockchain professionals back the project including:

* Nick Mudge is an Ethereum contract programmer and author of important Ethereum standards such as EIP-2535 (Diamond Standard), ERC1538, and ERC998. He has been deeply involved in blockchain development for over six years and contributed to the discussions that led to the ERC721 standard.  
* Sameep Singhania is co-founder of Ginete Technologies and has spent the past two years helping businesses adopt blockchain technologies. His focus is on making decentralized technologies more accessible.  
* Roc Zacharias is co-founder of QuickSwap and CEO of Lunar Digital Assets, a blockchain marketing firm. He is also a core contributor to the Dogechain project and has played a key role in the growth of QuickSwap.
