Lumia is teaming up with Orbs Liquidity Hub to help tackle one of DeFi’s toughest challenges: fragmented liquidity. As the first hyper-liquid zkEVM platform, Lumia is bringing next-gen technology to the table, optimizing trade execution and liquidity aggregation across multiple chains. This integration is a leap forward in making decentralized finance faster, smoother, and more efficient.

### Why This Matters

Fragmented liquidity is the bane of DeFi - causing slippage, higher trading costs, and missed opportunities. Lumia’s integration into Orbs Liquidity Hub changes the game by helping to power its dynamic on-chain solver auction system. Here, solvers compete to fill trade orders by pulling liquidity from AMM pools, cross-chain reserves, and off-chain sources.

The result? Better pricing and seamless execution that blows traditional DEX-AMM models out of the water. Together, Lumia and Orbs Liquidity Hub empower DEXs to aggregate liquidity effortlessly, delivering some of the best trade outcomes without the hassle of manual sourcing.

### The Role of Lumia in Liquidity Hub

Lumia’s advanced zkEVM tech stack adds to Orbs Liquidity Hub’s meta-aggregation layer, creating a unique optimization that taps into both on-chain and off-chain liquidity. Here’s what Lumia brings to the table:

- **Hyper-Liquid Trade Execution**: With zkEVM architecture, Lumia enables lightning-fast cross-chain and multi-chain trading.
- **Decentralized Liquidity Network**: Powered by Lumia Stream, liquidity provisioning is scalable and efficient, creating deep pools for DeFi assets.
- **Cross-Chain Connectivity**: Lumia’s infrastructure ensures a smooth integration, giving DEXs and traders a unified liquidity experience across chains.

This integration means trades can be routed through the most optimal liquidity paths, slashing slippage and costs for users while delivering next-level efficiency.

### How Liquidity Hub Works

The Orbs Liquidity Hub operates as a [Layer-3 (L3)](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-3s-crypto) meta aggregator, sitting above AMMs to optimize trades. By leveraging Lumia’s zk-powered capabilities, DEXs can bypass traditional AMM limitations.

When a trade can’t be executed better than the AMM price, the transaction seamlessly reverts to the AMM contract, ensuring no missed opportunities or delays.
