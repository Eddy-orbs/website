### Pain and Solution - 
### Removing Centralized Points of Failure

As the industry evolves, DeFi and Web 3.0 protocols and applications are becoming more and more complex. Yet, while the protocols and applications are evolving, smart contracts are still inherently limited in nature as they are sandboxed by design. For example, smart contracts cannot trigger future actions at arbitrary conditions or times since state changes require something external to the contract to initiate a transaction. This means that a lot of the new breeds of DeFi and Web 3.0 projects may still need to execute a significant portion of their functionality using centralized backend infrastructure. 

It is not difficult to explain why centralized backend infrastructure is not optimal for DeFi and Web 3.0 projects, as it contradicts the trustless ideal of the industry. Centralization poses security and robustness risks due to the existence of a single point of failure. Centralized infrastructure exposes project participants to malicious behavior, increases legal liability and is usually expensive and difficult to maintain.


This is where Orbs L3 comes in. The Orbs Network operates as a decentralized serverless cloud allowing developers to extend smart contracts with L3 decentralized backend services. These are deployed to be executed by Orbs PoS validators (known as Guardians) and relieve projects of the need to rely on centralized backend solutions. Such interactions may be simplistic, such as sending transactions at a specific time or upon a specific event, or more complex, with logic in high level languages like JavaScript and Python.
