## Layer 3 

###  The missing piece in the blockchain stack

The first infrastructure layer: L1, like Ethereum, is in charge of security.\
The second infrastructure layer: L2, such as Polygon, is in charge of scalability.\
The third infrastructure layer: L3 is in charge of executing more complex logics and scripts that cannot be
 implemented on smart contracts alone. This layer provides services to existing DeFi applications for further
  decentralization and enhanced capabilities.
