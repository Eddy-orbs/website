# Aggregated liquidity for
# decentralized exchangesÂ 

Liquidity Hub is a decentralized optimization layer that operates above Automated Market Makers (AMMs). This layer mitigates the problem of fragmented liquidity in DeFi, enabling DEXs to tap into external liquidity sources in order to provide better prices on swaps.

The Liquidity Hub is a beta version that is still under active development. For more information, please see the [terms of use](/liquidity-hub-terms-of-use)
