In order to participate in the Orbs universe, token holders are required to stake their tokens and select a Guardian to delegate their voting power to.
In order to simplify the interaction with the staking contract, the Orbs team developed the [Tetra wallet](https://staking.orbs.network/), with a simple and convenient interface. The Tetra staking wallet allows you to stake your tokens and select a Guardian to delegate to.
 
For the release of Orbs V3 Tetra has been updated to enable staking on Polygon with a simple and intuitive UI to switch between the Ethereum and Polygon networks.
