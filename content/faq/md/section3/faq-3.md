No. The [ORBS PoS Wallet](orbs-pos-info-app-is-now-launched) app is connected to “Samsung blockchain keystore” and ledger,  which do not yet support Polygon. Therefore, as of right now the app can only be used for staking on Ethereum. 

The Orbs team will make an official announcement if and when the app can be used for Polygon staking as well.
