Orbs PoS V3: Multi-chain staking, [utilizes](https://www.orbs.com/Polygon-tech/) Orbs hybrid architecture and cross-chain properties to deploy a novel multi-chain PoS staking on Ethereum and Polygon. 

Adding Orbs PoS staking on Polygon means that the Orbs network utilizes the Ethereum stack to its fullest potential: The security of Ethereum as the base layer, and the scalability & low fees of Polygon as L2.

In this way, Orbs PoS V3 addresses one of the key feedbacks from the community and is expected to completely mitigate the current high Ethereum gas costs for Orbs delegators interacting with the Orbs staking contracts.
