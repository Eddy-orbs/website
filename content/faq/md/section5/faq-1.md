Yes! 
Orbs is integrated into the leading L1+L2 chains, making it available on 7 major infrastructure chains: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, Harmony and Fantom. In addition, Orbs is available on over 30 of the major DeFi platforms and protocols on each of the above chains (such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Kyber Network, 1inch, Alpaca Finance, Beefy Finance, QuickSwap, DinoSwap, Raydium, Trader Joe, Pangolin, with more to come in the near future...).
