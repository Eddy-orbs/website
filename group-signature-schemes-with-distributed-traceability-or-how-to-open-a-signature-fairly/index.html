That is, group participants can check, using verification keys, that a signature was indeed created by someone in the group but they cannot tell by whom. In case of disputes or misbehavior, a tracing authority uses its tracing key to trace back the signer.</p><p  class='text-p'>For some use cases having a single tracing authority works. However, in many other cases there is no single authority that everyone trusts for revoking anonymity and so it makes more sense to divide responsibility between several authorities. This insight lead Benjumea et al. to design “<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/047.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>Fair traceable multi-group signatures</em></a>”. In their scheme opening a signature is possible if multiple fairness authorities cooperate. The fairness authorities can also cooperate to reveal a tracing key of a user under suspicion. This key can be used to check if a message was signed by a certain user without revoking the anonymity of the other users.</p><p  class='text-p'>To this day, there are several signature schemes with distributed traceability that differ slightly regarding to the functionality they offer, such as “<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/112.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Democratic Group Signatures with Threshold Traceability</a>” by Zheng et al., and “<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dfd3/0ee27ab7167900dbdddff11b22132f9ea5d5.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Short group Signatures with Distributed Traceability</a>” by Blomer et al., on which I will elaborate further.</p><h3 id="group-signatures-with-distributed-traceability-in-helix"  class='title-h3'
    >Group signatures with distributed traceability in Helix</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>At Orbs, we are developing <a href="https://www.orbs.com/helix-consensus-white-paper" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Helix</a>, our original consensus protocol which is especially designed for ensuring transactions are ordered in a fair way. The key concept in Helix is that network nodes cannot manipulate which transactions are included in a new block or their ordering. In particular they cannot censor specific nodes or users, and cannot favor their own transactions in a substantial way. You can read more about Helix in this blog <a href="https://medium.com/orbs-network/helix-the-orbs-consensus-algorithm-af5e6dc08856" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>post.</a></p><p  class='text-p'>A major contributor for fairness in Helix is having the users encrypt their transactions and then decrypt the original transactions only after they are appended to the blockchain. Encrypting the transactions comes at a price, in particular, it raises the need to punish users and nodes who are sending junk to the network instead of valid transactions. For this reason we need a mechanism for revealing which network nodes are responsible for problematic transactions in order to diminish their reputation.</p><p  class='text-p'>We can do this using group signatures with distributed traceability, by having each network node serve as a fairness authority and require a threshold number of authorities to open and trace signatures.</p><p  class='text-p'>I now turn to describing the flow a transaction makes in Helix and how group signatures with distributed traceability can be used. If you are less interested about this particular flow you can skip ahead and read about the candidate signature scheme. The flow starts when a user creates a transaction, encrypts it, and sends it to a network node that it is associated with. The network node then signs the transaction using a fair traceable group signature scheme and relays the transaction to the network. Before including the transaction in a block, the block creator checks the transaction has a valid group signature. After the block is appended to the blockchain, we initiate a process (which requires a threshold number of nodes) for decrypting the transactions in the block. If needed (for example, the decrypted transaction turns out to be invalid) a threshold number of nodes cooperate and open the signature in order to reveal which node signed this transaction.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another possible option for the flow is to open the signatures by default in parallel to the decryption process. The advantage of opening the signature by default is that this way we do not need to initiating a special protocol for faulty transactions and instead have this process executed as part of the normal flow. Another option is to incorporate the process of revealing a tracing key (used to trace a specific misbehaving node). We also note that some group signature schemes also have claim functionality, in which signers can claim the signature as belonging to them, which we did not use in the above flow.</p><p  class='text-p'>From our flow we deduce the <strong>security requirements</strong> we seek:</p><ul>
<li>Anonymity: A group signature does not reveal the identity of the member who produced it, unless more than a threshold number of fairness authorities cooperate.</li>
<li>Traceability maintains anonymity: If a node claims it is the originator of a signature or its identity was revealed as part of the tracing algorithm, this does not comprise the privacy of the remaining past or future group signatures that it issues.</li>
<li>Unlinkability: It is impossible to relate two or more signatures as being produced by the same signer without cooperation of a threshold number of authorities.</li>
<li>Non-frameability: Even if the group and tracing managers collude with the rest of the group, they cannot frame an honest group member. A user may be framed in two different ways: the authorities and other users may construct a signature that opens or traces to an innocent user (this requirement is also called strong exculpability), or they may claim a signature that was generated by the user as their own.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Other important requirements are: supporting dynamic change of signers and tracers, and not requiring trusted setup.</p><h3 id="-strong-candidate-signature-scheme-strong-"  class='title-h3'
    ><strong>Candidate Signature Scheme</strong></h3>
<p  class='text-p'>One of the most efficient signature scheme currently known is by Boneh, Boyen and Shacham (BBS), which they introduced in their paper “<a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/groupsigs.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Short group signatures.</a>” Their signature scheme lacks a few properties required for our use. Firstly, their group signature scheme does not provide distributed traceability but rather requires a centralized tracing authority. In addition, their scheme does not satisfy “traceability maintains anonymity” property (because it does not provide CCA-anonymity, explained later on) which is crucial in our setting. Moreover, the key generation process requires a trusted dealer. Fortunately, there are follow-up papers that take care of the first two issues. The ideas can be combined to achieve a CCA-anonymous signature scheme that offers distributed traceability. Getting rid of the trusted dealer is an issue that needs to be addressed if we choose this scheme.</p><p  class='text-p'>In a paper by Blomer et. al, “Short group signatures with distributed traceability,” the scheme of BBS is extended to support distributed traceability. This is achieved in the following way. In the BBS scheme, part of the signature is an encryption of (part of) the secret key, and opening amounts to decrypting this ciphertext. In the paper by Blomer they change the encryption to threshold encryption. Opening a signature consists of two processes, the first is producing an open share from the signature, and the second is combining a threshold number of shares to decrypt back the signer’s key. Another modification they make is adding an additional element to the secret key which is only known to the user and not to the fairness authorities. This guarantees that fairness authorities cannot sign on behalf of other members.</p><p  class='text-p'>The scheme by BBS provides CPA-anonymity. Roughly, this means that the signatures are anonymous provided that the adversary does not get to query the trace signatures protocol. However, this assumption is not justified in our setting since an adversary may produce signed messages and send them to the blockchain, and afterwards they will be traced as part of our normal flow. Therefore, we require the signature scheme to be CCA-anonymous, which means that even an adversary which has access the open\tracing protocol, cannot trace the signature without cooperating with a threshold number of fairness authorities. In his paper, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11535218_10" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Communication-efficient non-interactive proofs of knowledge with online extractors</a>,” Fischlin introduces a method for transforming the signature scheme by BBS to be CCA-secure. This works by adding component to the signature which is generating a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge for the random values used when encrypting. Informally, this ensures that the adversary does not gain much from interacting with the tracing protocol since in order to sign a valid message she had to know the random values used for generating the encryption in the first place.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Size of the signature</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>The length of the BBS group signature scheme under the parameters suggested by the authors is 1,533 bits. This is comparable to the size of RSA signature, which is 1,024 or 2,048 bits long for signatures with similar security. Adding distributed traceability does not make the signature longer, but complexity wise it requires calculating lagrange polynomial interpolation in order to combine shares.</p><p  class='text-p'>As for the zero knowledge proof of knowledge , this is relatively large in size and is costly to compute. For the parameters suggested in the paper, the length of is 3,520 bits, which amounts to a signature length of 5,053 bits total.</p><p  class='text-p'>The size of the signature shares are 340 bits per share.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><em>I would like to thank Steven Goldfeder for helpful discussions on the subject.</em></p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
