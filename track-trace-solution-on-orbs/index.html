    >Introduction to the Track &amp; Trace Use-Case</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>As the world has gotten flatter and supply chains have gotten ever more complex, the need for companies to follow best practices in global supply chain management has intensified. Global manufacturing and shipping firms, face a growing problem managing their supply chain logistics, to the point that it has become increasingly difficult to track where their products end up.</p><p  class='text-p'>For most manufacturing firms, the end of their span of interest is usually up until the point when the product leaves the factory. As it turns out, these manufacturers have very little knowledge about what happens to their products once they leave their factories, through their supply chain and all the way to the consumers.</p><p  class='text-p'>In this post, we’ll demonstrate why a public blockchain is the optimal technological solution for track &amp; trace use-case.</p><h2 id="the-problem"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >The Problem</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>In the recent decade, challenges in the global market supply-demand that companies know more and more about their products’ journey all the way to the end-user. Wholesale companies that neglect the distribution and supply chain aspect of their operation, face real pain-points in several major areas, like these:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/track-trace-solution-on-orbs/fafafafa-1030x718.jpg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>These problems are not unique to any specific company but are well-known throughout the entire industry. For instance, Nike recently decided to <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/25/why-amazon-losing-nike-highlights-a-major-risk.aspx" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>sever its relationship with Amazon</a> due to the latter’s inability to quell competition from counterfeits. Similarly, product recalls are becoming more and more frequent and can i<a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T018-S001-20-dividend-stocks-to-fund-20-years-of-retirement/index.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ncur huge losses</a>. Having the ability to act swiftly and carry out an effective, or “smart”, recall can make a huge difference when dealing with such a crisis.</p><h1 id="the-solution"  class='title-h1 title'
    >The Solution</h1>
<p  class='text-p'>In light of all of the above, the Orbs team was approached by several enterprises with a request to offer a possible solution. Orbs Ltd. presented its track &amp; trace solution built on the Orbs blockchain, which can be separated into 2 main parts:</p><p  class='text-p'>The first part of the solution included a unique identifier for each end-product package, such as a QR code or an RFID tag. This identifier will be scanned through every stage of the supply chain process, from the factory floor all the way to the point of sale. In this way, the company would have an event record that tracks their entire inventory of products throughout their supply chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>The second part of the solution is a robust analytics platform that constantly analyzes this data and visualizes the information. This back-office tool informs the company in real-time on any irregularities and risks that can occur during the supply chain process.</p><p  class='text-p'>For example, a product destined to be sold in Bangladesh and two weeks later shows up in a mixing center in Germany, will immediately raise an alarm that something has gone wrong in their supply chain. The system would allow the company to track the shipment route of the product and verify what happened.</p><p  class='text-p'>Together, a unique identifier coupled with a robust analysis platform makes a substantial improvement over existing track and trace methods.</p><h1 id="why-blockchain-"  class='title-h1 title'
    >Why Blockchain?</h1>
<p  class='text-p'>Blockchain technology is best used when there’s a need to facilitate trust guarantees between multiple entities.</p><p  class='text-p'>At first glance, in our case, it’s not easy to identify where that trust is required as we are dealing with a single company with the aim of optimizing a logistic process. Can this not be achieved on a centralized database?</p><p  class='text-p'>The reality is that it could not.</p><p  class='text-p'>The reason is that in order to follow the product distribution network, the company needed the support and cooperation of multiple suppliers and partners - carriers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers. These 3rd parties are justifiably reluctant to implement such a system since if each and every brand establishes a system of its own, these partners would be overwhelmed by an impossible jungle of systems. The utilization of a Blockchain-based event ledger enables the establishment of a single messaging layer not owned by any individual brand.</p><p  class='text-p'>A blockchain-based solution, not owned and controlled by a single entity, allows the different market competitors to cooperate without the fear of giving up control over their data and who they share it with. Moreover, it allows for easy integration of the solution to the various supply chain partners (logistic providers, retailers, etc.). This design allows each stakeholder in the system to gain from the solution and to facilitate the formation of a single standard, versus the fragmented and chaotic current state of affairs.</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/track-trace-solution-on-orbs/8888Asset-8-100-scaled.jpg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Private blockchains, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/industries/supply-chain" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>IBM Hyperledger</a>, also offer supply chain management solutions. However, they lack the ability to offer multiple partners with guarantees of inclusiveness, fairness, and best economic value. As we argue in this <a href="https://www.orbs.com/private-vs-public-blockchain/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>article</a>, we believe that in the long run, the future will favor public blockchain-based solutions because of reasons such as guarantees, interoperability, permissionless open protocols, and more.</p><p  class='text-p'>A schematic representation of the Orbs’ solution building blocks is presented in Figure 2:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/track-trace-solution-on-orbs/8888Asset-9-100-scaled.jpg" alt="Schematic representation of the track &amp; trace solution"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>As can be seen in Figure 2, the basis of the solution is a messaging platform built on top of the Orbs blockchain, which handles the data coming in from the external world. Each entity using the solution can decide the visibility of the data they are contributing to the blockchain and who else can see it. Each participant feeds the data available to him into an analysis tool that visualizes the information and alerts in case of suspicious activity. This part is a proprietary solution for each player, based on their goals and targets.</p><p  class='text-p'>This design allows each partner in the supply chain to interact with the system to his benefits -</p><ul>
<li>The manufacturer can track how the product reaches the point of sale.</li>
<li>The distribution partners can know how long the product has been sitting in their warehouse, and know if they have a stale inventory.</li>
<li>The sale store can verify the authenticity of the product in case of a return or warranty claim.</li>
<li>and so on...</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="summary"  class='title-h1 title'
    >Summary</h1>
<p  class='text-p'>As discussed above, companies who do not employ track &amp; trace solutions to their supply chains may be exposed to certain risks such as loss of profitability and brand protection issues. Up to date, there has been no efficient solution to solve this issue. The emergence of new blockchain-based solutions can help turn this reality around.</p><p  class='text-p'>A working solution can bring immediate benefits to any company in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>Be able to detect entry point of fake products into the supply chain</li>
<li>Verify the authenticity of products</li>
<li>Identify supply chain failures (missing, stale, theft…)</li>
<li>Enable ‘smart’ recalls</li>
<li>Provide on-shelf availability insights and real-time alerts</li>
<li>Protect retailers against unauthorized returns</li>
<li>Protect distributors from rogue wholesalers</li>
</ul>

In this short timeframe, Orbs has managed to design and build a working pilot, ready to go into the next level of production.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs team is very excited about this particular use-case and its potential to on-board enterprise users onto the Orbs network.</p><p  class='text-p'>We will continue to update on the progress, stay tuned!</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><em>If you want to learn more about how blockchain technology could help your company better track &amp; trace its supply chain, <a href="../mailto:hello@orbs.com" rel="noopener">reach out today</a>; we’ll be happy to explore the best solution to fit your needs.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>For more updates, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/orbs_network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs on Twitter</a>!

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
