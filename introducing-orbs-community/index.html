In recent weeks, we’ve been mulling heavily over different ways to extend Orbs to the public and create an open environment for discussion and collaboration about the project. For this, we have to nurture a productive community of all participants in the Orbs Universe - delegators, developers, guardians, and validators.</p><h2 id="goals-for-this-channel"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Goals for this channel</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Many considerations were taken into account, and ultimately there are three major community discussion goals we consider crucial:</p><h4 id="-strong-transparency-strong-"  class='title-h4'
    ><strong>Transparency</strong></h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Our belief that anyone who is interested should be able to see and discuss the future of Orbs is deeply ingrained into our ethos. We did not like the idea of a secluded forum in which only those ‘in the know’ actively partake. On the contrary; we wish to invite all lurkers to view the open conversations and jump in when they feel ready to contribute. The plurality of opinion is also important: As a community-run project, there is no one “official” point of view. Anyone should be able to contribute.</p><h4 id="-strong-collaboration-strong-"  class='title-h4'
    ><strong>Collaboration</strong></h4>
<p  class='text-p'>First and foremost, we wanted to provide space for cooperation, collaboration, and participation among any and all wishing to partake in the development of the Orbs open ecosystem and open source project. We want you to be able to easily propose changes to the system and, just as importantly, enable others to understand and endorse your vision of what the Orbs Network can become/enable.</p><h4 id="-strong-education-strong-"  class='title-h4'
    ><strong>Education</strong></h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Another crucial goal of the Orbs community-to-be would be fostering learning. We want to lay the foundation for a place that would not only provide educational materials but also facilitate the asking of questions. And of course, provide a reliable place for answers. Many of our community members are a well of knowledge, a resource we are surely missing out on if our communication is a one-way stream.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>We want the discussion to be constructive and focus on how to participate in the Orbs ecosystem. We will do our best to fight spam, toxicity, and speculation that is in no way productive to using the project or making it better.</p><h2 id="moderated-by-the-community"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Moderated by the community</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a decentralized project. As such, it must be run by its community, not by a company or its core team. We see the position of the core team as the first members of this community, as leaders and as educators. Any constructive member of the community can become a moderator. If you want to help moderate this community, please start by participating. Ask questions, answer questions, help others. If you’re a developer, contribute to the codebase. When you feel you’ve established that you have the community’s best interest in mind, ask one of the existing moderators to add you as a moderator.</p><p  class='text-p'>Of course, all are invited and encouraged to answer community posts. We will, as much as we can, employ a hands-off approach.</p><p  class='text-p'>We’ve done our best to place this board on neutral territory. The board is hosted by a well-known third-party service, we’re not using our own servers to host the content nor do we have access to the hosting servers. We’ve tried our best to rely on social logins like Github and Google and disabled dedicated sign-up by email and password (nobody in the community should hold this data).</p><p  class='text-p'>The success of the Orbs network ultimately depends on the app developers and businesses who will build on top of the platform, validators and guardians to put the technology into practice, other teams to join in developing the technology and delegators to be involved in the proof of stake ecosystem and keep the network safe. We hope this forum will become a productive environment for making this vision a reality.</p><h2 id="good-topics-for-discussion"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Good topics for discussion</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Here are examples of the types of post topics we expect to see on the board, that are best discussed in a public, open forum instead of in Slack or private correspondence:</p><ul>
<li><p  class='text-p'><em>I want to play around with an Orbs node. I’ve just installed Gamma, and have a few suggestions on how we can make it even a better tool.</em></p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'><em>I’m trying to develop a simple app on Orbs. I’m unable to deploy my contract. Can anyone help?</em></p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'><em>Hey! I just became a Guardian and want to get others on board and announce myself to potential delegators. Where should I begin?</em></p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'><em>How do I go about becoming a Validator?</em></p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'><em>I’m trying to delegate my ORBS tokens to a Guardian. I’m not sure that it worked, how can I check?</em></p></li>
<li><p  class='text-p'><em>I wrote a blog post comparing the Orbs PoS model to this of Tezos. Let me know what you guys think!</em></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bad-topics-for-discussion"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Bad topics for discussion</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>We want to keep the discussion on point. We are aware that this industry, in general, attracts speculation over trade. We don’t see these discussions as constructive to the future of the project, which will depend on the long-term efforts of our whole community and not on short-term speculation.</p><p  class='text-p'>Please avoid discussing token price, token trade, listing in exchanges and so forth. This is not the place for conversations on cryptocurrencies in general and whether the market will grow or shrink. Do not use the group for sharing investment or trading advice or your personal financial transactions.</p><h2 id="why-discourse-though-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Why Discourse though?</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Most of you are probably thinking “Ok Nate, everything you are saying sounds great (and also you are very handsome). Why Discourse specifically though, instead of using Slack or a dedicated subreddit?” I will mention a few of the reasons for choosing the Discourse platform. Naturally, there are benefits and drawbacks to different apps and tools, and finding the right one for the community’s needs is a matter of optimization and compromise. We chose Discourse for three primary reasons which set it apart from other platforms:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Discoverability</strong> While Telegram and Slack are undoubtedly impressive apps that work quite smoothly and popular in the cryptosphere, they are awful for continuous conversation due to the fleeting nature of their messages. The ideal conversation hub for participants is one with a searchable archive, with threads that can be referred to easily. This requires structure.</li>
<li><strong>Structure</strong> Speaking of structure, we very much like the way topics are displayed in Discourse. Reddit has no clear structure and support. It’s optimized for noisy communities where 5% of the content is interesting and sorting mechanisms must float it to the top. Moderation tools for Reddit are too complex. And unlike Reddit, which requires an unholy amount of subreddit design to meet the bare minimum of structure in conversation, Discourse appears to have all the features of the best subreddits already baked in.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Open Source</strong> Discourse is a migration-friendly, open source project which fits our own philosophy. Aside from that, it allowed us to enable user logins from accounts they have personal control over (e.g Github login) so that we have no control over user data. We prefer it this way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hop-on-to-the-community-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Hop on to the community!</h2>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://community.orbs.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://community.orbs.network</a></p><p  class='text-p'>So there you have it! We wanted to achieve the right balance between educational wikis and conversational Slack, and the middle ground we found was to open a searchable, open, public Discourse board as the bedrock for our budding community.</p><p  class='text-p'>Now let’s build Orbs together!</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="https://docs.orbs.network/contract-sdk/" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source.

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
