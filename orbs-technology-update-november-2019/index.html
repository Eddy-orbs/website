<p  class='text-p'><em>There were many changes,  and improvements happening since <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-tech-update-september-2019/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>the last tech update</a>, so once again, we are happy to give you an overview of some of the things we achieved during this time.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>One significant related effort is the creation of Marvin, a new stress testing and endurance testing suite that will alert and help identify cases where code changes lead to performance degradations.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>An important aspect of the network is its liveness, and we&#39;ve added an internal metric of the liveness of validators. The metric, very basically, checks how many times a validator failed to close a block. Such failure can be because he was malicious or simply because he experienced a brief network outage. If the number of consecutive failures increases, it will hurt the node&#39;s &quot;reputation. This value can help guardians to make an informed decision about voting out nodes that impair the liveness of the entire network. Speaking of reputation, read below about the new status page, that shows the status of live validators.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>In case you didn&#39;t notice, the Orbs team released and the validators accepted version 1.2.2 of Orbs network in October, featuring time-based elections, triggers, and the reputation mechanism just mentioned.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>You may have noticed in the past company updates, our continued efforts in driving real-world usage to our platform. Below you&#39;ll read about many developments related to the user side of the system, a new demo page that includes links to several demos you can quickly and easily try yourself, and many more.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Another important effort that was made by the research team is to finalize the new staking scheme and enable the utilization of a Management Chain functionality. You can read below the details as well as some of the design decisions that were made during their development.</em></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Finally, two new developers started contributing to our code, and below you&#39;ll be able to read more details about their contributions so far, as well as the details of the things highlighted above and many, many more updates.</em></p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="-strong-blockchain-core-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

</ul>
</li>
<li>After a Gamma version with a broken Golang contract compiler has been released by mistake, added a test that attempts to deploy a contract against a Gamma server running in Docker <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1342" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1342</a></li>
<li>Refactored the Golang contract processor to allow instantiating it with a different set of pre-built contracts than what’s used in production <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1359" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1359</a></li>
<li>Removed the Ethereum simulator usage from our codebase; previously, component tests in the Ethereum cross-chain connector package were being run against go-ethereum’s <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/accounts/abi/bind/backends/simulated.go" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SimulatedBackend</a>. This caused problems, as it was not intended to actually simulate a full-blow Ethereum network, but rather to just allow running contracts against en EVM. Specifically, the Orbs network uses complicated logic to fetch a “final enough” block number in Ethereum for a transaction that’s currently being executed, so that a transaction will not run a possible block that doesn’t end up in the longest Ethereum chain. This logic is dependent on block number, a concept that’s not supported in SimulatedBackend. As a solution, the Orbs network now runs all of its tests against <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Ganache</a>. <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1369" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1369</a></li>
<li>While investigating a port collision in the in-process E2E test, we found out that if an Orbs node is started with a Gossip port that’s already in use, it will endlessly attempt - and fail - to listen to that port. This PR (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1401" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1401</a>) changes this behavior, so now the node will panic and exit in this case.</li>
<li>A common reason for flakiness was that the Gossip TCP server opens a goroutine for each incoming connection, and these goroutines were not being supervised. This resulted in logs being written after tests have been completed, which is not allowed in Golang tests. <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1412" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1412</a></li>

Marvin identifies performance degradation or increases in errors when merging PRs into the master branch. This prevents regression in production code. It does so by running stress and endurance tests against a test network and comparing present and past results.</p><p  class='text-p'>Summarized test results are sent to the developer, along with comparison to existing master branch. In addition, full test results are accessible via Grafana dashboard or directly in the Prometheus TSDB (Time Series database). Prometheus continuously collects metrics from the main test network that runs the master branch. In phase II it will gain the ability to run on every push to an open PR for more immediate developer feedback, and will be able to test the effect of pushing PRs to master prior to actually doing so, preventing unwanted merges. It will also collect logs into an ELK stack for deeper analysis.</p><p  class='text-p'>An initial version of the client that exercises the test network is already written in Go, and the two additional Node.js processes are underway. These are (1) the Orchestrator that listens to external requests (such as from CircleCI) and spawns JobExecutor instances per test job, and (2) the JobExecutor that runs multiple instances of the Go clients. The full code is available on the <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/marvin" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Marvin repo</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Running stress tests against testnet yields a notification to Slack, such as this one:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-technology-update-november-2019/image2.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'><em>(Disclaimer: This is still in development, the results will be more detailed, will compare against previous runs, and will be aggregated from more transactions over a longer time period.)</em></p><p  class='text-p'>Here is Grafana sample output (not related to the Slack message above):</p><p  class='text-p'><strong><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/orbs-technology-update-november-2019/image1.png" alt=""></figure></strong></p><p  class='text-p'><em><a href="https://github.com/noambergIL" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>@noambergIL</a></em></p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Reputation &amp; Committee Generation</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>This new feature allows every Orbs-node to save information about the behavior of the validators. The node keeps track of how many times in a row a validator failed to close a block. When a validator doesn&#39;t close a block, we will make it less likely for it to be the leader of the block committee - this helps the liveliness of the network. Soon this information would be present to the guardians, so they may choose to vote against misbehaving validators.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1299" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1299</a></p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1297" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1297</a></p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1296" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1296</a></p><h3 id="new-types"  class='title-h3'

<p  class='text-p'>Orbs-nodes can support four new types of arguments in public methods of the contract (methods that can be called from the client directly): bool, *big.Int, [20]byte &amp; [32]byte.

<h3 id="orbs-staking-contract"  class='title-h3'
    >Orbs Staking Contract</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The R&amp;D activities on Orbs PoS architecture were focused on the Orbs staking contract.</p><p  class='text-p'>The staking contract development was completed and is now undergoing an external security audit. The contract is available for review in the <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-staking-contract" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>orbs-staking-contract GitHub repo</a> along with a <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-staking-contract/blob/master/docs/CONTRACT.md" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>high-level specification</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs network staking contract is set to be deployed on Ethereum similarly to the ORBS native token. The use of an ERC20 token and a staking contract on the Ethereum blockchain enables the Orbs PoS hybrid model. In the Orbs PoS model, the staking, delegation and validators selection process are done on Ethereum and the Orbs network calculates the election results along with the earned rewards based on the data logged on Ethereum.</p><p  class='text-p'>The staking contract enables Orbs token holders to stake tokens, request to unstake them, entering a cooldown period and withdraw tokens back to their ORBS ERC20 account.</p><p  class='text-p'>An interesting aspect of the Orbs staking contract is the migration strategy. First and foremost, the contract is designed to be immutable such that stakers’ funds are secured and one can not move staked tokens or modify the staking properties without the staker approval. On the other hand, we want to allow stakers to transition to new staking contracts in the future without requiring them to first unstake before staking in a new contract, leaving them without staked tokens for the cooldown period. The proposed staking contract addresses the issue by allowing stakers to explicitly request to migrate their stake to a new staking contract thus allowing a seamless transition.</p><p  class='text-p'>A complementary product for the staking contract is a staking wallet to enable a simpler interface for staking. A staking wallet allows ORBS token holders to interact with the contract without a need to manually construct the transactions. We’ve designed a product definition for such a staking wallet and are starting to develop it. The staking wallet we’re working on may be used by the Orbs community as a reference implementation for additional wallet implementations..</p><h3 id="new-features"  class='title-h3'
    >New Features</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/gadcl" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Gad</a> has completed the specs of two new features: the Management Chain and the Ethereum Proxy.</p><p  class='text-p'>In addition to the benefits coming from the introduction of the Management Chain (see more in the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/orbs-tech-update-september-2019/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>previous tech update</a>), its inclusion obliges supplementing the Orbs network’s infrastructure with cross-Virtual Chain (VC) communication. Communication between different VCs will be regularly used between any VC and the Management Chain but can be employed for other uses such as the design pattern of hierarchical VCs. The management chain will hold every VC’s configuration, for example, the current VC’s validators set. This, in turn, will facilitate coordination between validators assigned to operate a new VC. However, it also implies that the VC is no longer standalone. To audit a VC (and verify its state transitions), one must consume the VC’s configuration from the management chain.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Ethereum Proxy feature will significantly facilitate the process of obtaining and calculating the Election results from Ethereum. Among its benefits is the removal of the external agent that mirrors the Ethereum data and relaxation of demands from an Ethereum node. Now, an Ethereum node needs only to support state queries for the latest 100 blocks rather than 5000 blocks as it formerly used to be.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>Everything we develop is, as always, updated in our GitHub repositories. Here, we try to point to the things that are actually done and ready to be used, rather than discuss ongoing developments and future plans.</p><p  class='text-p'>Just like in previous updates, and as part of being true to our goal to develop enterprise-class software, we continuously labor to improve ORBS&#39; stability.

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
