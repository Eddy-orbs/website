This post will not go into the specifics of the mechanics and will not go into exact numbers (this information is available here). Instead, we’ll focus on motivation and the main idea.</em></p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>The ideas in this post are simplified to make the model easier to understand. The following posts on the topic go into the specifics in a more precise and accurate way.</p><h3 id="validators"  class='title-h3'
    >Validators</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><em>Validators</em> play an essential role in the Orbs network. They operate the Orbs nodes, run the consensus algorithm, sign blocks and approve transactions for the decentralized apps. Validators should also provide assurances that they’re good actors and indeed follow the protocol.</p><ul>
<li><strong>What skills are needed for being a good validator?</strong> Operating a node in a high throughput network like Orbs requires technical proficiency. The node should have high availability, it has to be fast, it has to be kept secure and updated. Running a node is a full-time profession. We want validators who are committed to this task and will develop the expertise needed for performing it well.</li>
<li><strong>What’s the incentive for being a validator?</strong> Validators are compensated for their service to the network since they do the heavy lifting of running the protocol and provide assurances for honesty. Part of the payment comes from fees, paid by apps for running their virtual chains. Another part comes from rewards given from the token reserve whose purpose is attracting quality validators in the early bootstrap years of the network.</li>
<li><strong>How many validators are needed?</strong> The network requires between several dozens to several hundreds of validators. The issue here is how to know whether a validator is good. Validators can abuse their position and cause damage to the network.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>One of the goals of the proof-of-stake model is making sure the best validators are selected. This voting process is based on stake because almost every other method is susceptible to manipulation.</p><h3 id="optimizing-the-voting-process"  class='title-h3'
    >Optimizing the voting process</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>If stake in the network is used for voting and electing validators, we can identify two main goals for optimizing this process:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Have as much stake as possible participate.</strong> Electing validators is an important task. Since proof-of-stake models assume that the majority of stake in the network is honest, the more stake we get to participate, the harder it will be to manipulate the results and compromise the network.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage educated votes and proper due diligence.</strong> If we could get all stake to participate but every voter would just choose a result randomly, would this benefit the network? Of course not. Votes are only meaningful if the voter has taken the time to make an educated selection.</li>
</ol>
<p  class='text-p'>It appears that these two goals are somewhat conflicting. Making an educated selection requires effort. The more effort we expect, the less participants we’ll find willing to make it. Pushing to increase the number of participants will naturally reduce the overall quality of participation.</p><p  class='text-p'>One of the interesting things the model tries to do is solve this conflict.</p><h3 id="guardians"  class='title-h3'
    >Guardians</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>If we want to increase the quality of votes, let’s try to characterize the ideal voter. We’ll call this voter a guardian because effort on their behalf — finding the best validators or rooting out problematic ones — is what’s essentially guarding the network and keeping it safe and secure.</p><ul>
<li><strong>What skills are needed for being a good guardian?</strong> A good guardian can perform meaningful due diligence on a validator. This may require some technical proficiency like running an audit node to check who’s following the protocol or measure a node’s uptime. This may also require checking for reputation and trust by looking up company records for example. Due diligence has to be done continuously because voting is a frequent process. An elected validator that fails to perform must be taken out quickly. In addition, guardians are community leaders among stakeholders so ability to educate other stakeholders and increase overall participation is a valuable skill as well.</li>
<li><strong>What’s the incentive for being a guardian?</strong> Guardians are expected to remain on guard and vote frequently. They are compensated for this service with token rewards from the reserve. Beyond this hard incentive, as leaders among stakeholders, guardians often hold significant stake providing a soft incentive for the network’s well being.</li>
<li><strong>How many guardians are needed?</strong> The more guardians active in the network the better, but remember that we want them to be experts. Due to the amount of effort involved, it is reasonable to expect that at least in the early days of the network not many stakeholders will be committed enough to perform the task consistently. Creating experts is no easy task. Continuous monitoring and due diligence is a lot to expect from a random stakeholder. Statistics show that engagement starts low. What can we do if we want the majority of stake to participate?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="delegators"  class='title-h3'
    >Delegators</h3>
<p  class='text-p'><em>Delegators</em> represent the silent majority, those on the opposite side of the engagement spectrum. To attract them to participate, we must reduce product friction to the absolute minimum and lower our requirements from them.</p><p  class='text-p'>Instead of frequent voting, we expect delegators the minimum of a single action — choosing a guardian to vote on their behalf.</p><ul>
<li><strong>What skills are needed for being a good delegator?</strong> No special skills, anyone can do it. Delegators who want to do more will become guardians and will actively participate in the frequent voting. But delegators unwilling to do more can still participate. Delegation is a very simple and frictionless process, no special tools required. If you can operate a standard Ethereum wallet and use ERC20 tokens, you will be able to delegate.</li>
<li><strong>What’s the incentive for being a delegator?</strong> Every participation provides value to the network and no matter how small, still requires some effort. Therefore, delegators who go to the trouble of selecting a guardian will be given token rewards from the reserve. This reward is given only if their guardian actually votes on their behalf. This will encourage delegators to replace guardians which become inactive. The reward for delegators will naturally be lower than the reward for guardians in order to encourage the maximum level of participation.</li>
<li><strong>How many delegators are needed?</strong> As many as possible. If a stakeholder has a choice between not participating at all or becoming a delegator, we want them to become a delegator.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-everything-fits-together"  class='title-h3'
    >How everything fits together</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Guardians are the representatives of stake. Every guardian must be active and is backed by delegators who chose them to vote on their behalf. Guardians vote using the stake they represent to choose the best validators. Validators do the heavy lifting of operating the network.</p><p  class='text-p'>In summary, delegators choose guardians, guardians choose validators.</p><h3 id="parallels-from-a-familiar-world"  class='title-h3'
    >Parallels from a familiar world</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>There’s not much new under the sun. Proof-of-stake is a form of governance. We can draw many parallels between it and delegative representative democracy, a system that has evolved for two millennia.</p><p  class='text-p'>Active participation in government is reserved for professionals, as it requires commitment and dedication. These professional politicians vote frequently on all matters of state and must be properly educated for the task. They are similar to guardians. They are chosen by the general public in infrequent low friction elections in attempt to drive participation by the general public to the maximum. The general public in this regard is similar to delegators.</p><h3 id="jump-into-the-orbs-universe"  class='title-h3'

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source.

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
