This entailed major refactors, mostly around shutting down the system in an orderly manner during tests.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/itamararjuan" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@itamararjuan</em></a> upgraded to Go 1.12.6 and switched <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs repo</a> and all its dependencies to use <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Go modules</a> instead of vendoring.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a> made progress with management chain, both on the research/spec front, and in development. Work is underway on the cross-chain adapter that would allow a contract running on the app chain to request data from the management chain&#39;s state.</p><p  class='text-p'>In addition, <a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a> resolved various flakiness and stability issues, and fixed a responsiveness issue in Gossip - see <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1305" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PR-1305</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a> have finalized and released the new Lean-Helix <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>goroutine</a> model, to be included in the upcoming version v1.2.0.</p><p  class='text-p'>In the previous Lean-Helix goroutine model, there was only a single goroutine. It did everything - handled incoming messages and events, performed all of Lean-Helix&#39; logic, and also called and waited on external, time-consuming services, such as collecting transactions into a new proposed block. While the goroutine was blocked on an external service, it naturally was not available for responding to messages and events, resulting in (sometimes significant) lags in response time.</p><p  class='text-p'>In the new model, a new goroutine has been added.</p><p  class='text-p'>The existing goroutine that handles everything is now called the <strong>worker loop</strong> and still does everything as before. The new goroutine, called <strong>main loop,</strong> steps in as a proxy in front of the worker loop, and gets to handle messages and events first. If a message or events should make a long-running process obsolete, the main loop immediately cancels the context of the long-running process, signaling it to stop as soon as possible. For example - a Leader Election event makes a long-running request for a new block obsolete, because the leader node that called it has now been replaced. Previously the long-running operation would have continued, only to discover when done that its results are stale and ignored.</p><p  class='text-p'>More info <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/lean-helix-go/blob/master/DEV-GUIDE.md#updated-threading-model" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>This task took far longer to complete than was originally planned. More so, when considering that of several alternatives, a rather modest solution was chosen, to reduce both risk and effort. As a result, we decided to run a retrospective review (sometimes called “post mortem”) of the entire process, to ensure that we understand the root causes and improve the community processes related to the development, Here is a summary of the retrospective process:</p><p  class='text-p'>That solution that is described above and was developed, is half-way towards a more comprehensive solution (of creating a separate, short-lived goroutine for every increment of height or view - this is out of scope for this document). This turned out to be counterproductive and led to difficulties in reasoning about errors that cropped up. As an additional complication, the existing tests were found to be flaky (that is, were occasionally failing) so a basic condition - using tests as a safety net for changes - was not met.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Major conclusions:</strong></p><ul>
<li>It is better to come up with an ambitious architecture that is sound engineering-wise than trying to come up with a seemingly quick solution that is not fully perceived by all parties as the right way to go. By &quot;sound engineering-wise&quot;, the meaning is easy to understand, explain to others, and debug when problems arise.</li>
<li>Raise a red flag as soon as a basic condition of having solid tests is found to be false - the vast majority of time spent on the project was in the area of tests and this was not taken into account when planning the project. The whole project&#39;s timeline and scope should have been rethought at that point.</li>
<li>As a positive point - despite difficulties during testing, the contributors persevered and fixed the testing framework so it is now far better than it was before. It would have been easy to simply update the production code with the addition of a new goroutine (production code, excluding tests, was updated in one day) but this would not have been up to par with the high standard of the Orbs project.</li>

With some simplification, there are 2 such networks: <strong>testnet-master</strong> which holds a release-candidate version, and <strong>chain-on-pr</strong> which is a virtual chain that is spawned on every push to an existing PR.</p><p  class='text-p'>Monitoring the performance of these networks will:</p><ul>
<li>Provide confidence in the performance of a release-candidate version</li>
<li>Provide quick feedback regression test for developers of new PRs. It will notify if the latest code change caused performance to drop or error count to rise.</li>

Here is a breakdown:</p><h3 id="pos-research"  class='title-h3'
    >PoS Research</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>We have drafted a spec of the staking contract (previously dubbed locking contract) and reviewed it internally (we also intend to external audit the contract before the deployment). We have decided to use a single staking contract, for both Delegators and Validators. This contract functions as a custodian retaining ORBS tokens for those who want to stake (lock) them in exchange for some rewards. ORBS token holders can stake tokens indefinitely in the staking contract. Once they wish to withdraw their coins, they will have to notify the contract and wait for the cooldown period (approximately one month) to pass. The Orbs blockchain will be directly connected to the staking contract - it will track its state changes and derive reward calculations, election results, and whatever else is necessary for the PoS mechanism. Currently, this is the only staking option. Nevertheless, participating in the PoS ecosystem without staking (locking) still stands.</p><p  class='text-p'>To conclude, we note that the contract’s spec also considers easy contract migrations. In the case of a migration from one staking contract to another, the staked tokens will move without requiring to withdraw them first.</p><h3 id="zero-knowledge"  class='title-h3'
    >Zero-Knowledge</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Our enthusiastic cryptographer, <a href="../mailto:idanp@orbs.com" rel="noopener">Idan</a>, continually explores the subject of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and its applications in Orbs. Recently, Idan made the first steps towards designing a zero-knowledge-proofs software development kit, intending to make ZKPs more accessible to developers. We are working towards a proof of concept that will enable developers to construct a large class of zero-knowledge systems from simpler primitives. In parallel, we keep track of recent advances in the field, staying up to date with the latest released papers.</p><h3 id="new-features"  class='title-h3'
    >New Features</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The specs for the features of ’Leader activity reputation’ and ‘Trigger mechanism’ were completed, reviewed, and handed to the Dev team for implementation (see <a href="https://www.orbs.com/rd-update-august-2019/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>previous R&amp;D update</a>). The ‘Management Chain’ spec has evolved, and we further elaborate on an interesting aspect addressed in it.</p><h3 id="management-chain"  class='title-h3'
    >Management Chain</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>A critical requirement from the design of the Management Chain is to allow virtual chains (VCs) to obtain close-to real-time information from the Management Chain. Due to the asynchronous way different chains communicate, achieving this goal is not an easy task. Therefore, a simple solution might introduce a non-deterministic execution of a VC, which leads to an agreement problem. To overcome this challenge and to preserve agreement among the Validators, we add a “safe verification rule”. This rule gives a block proposer some flexibility on the possible results coming from the interaction with the Management Chain. Thus assuring that an honest proposer will pass verification with very high probability. Dishonest proposers, though, are not guaranteed to pass verification and may be subject to reputation deterioration.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><h2 id="tlv-blockchain-week"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
