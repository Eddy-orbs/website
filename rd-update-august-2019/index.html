<p  class='text-p'>---- SEPARATOR ----</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Blockchain Core</strong></p><p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by</em> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>This month saw several features come to fruition and several others in the planning phase.</p><p  class='text-p'>Performing any kind of configuration change on the network (modifying timeouts, changing the max number of transactions per block, etc.) as well as adding new nodes, required a restart of the entire network. An important step in making Orbs platform more stable is <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1251" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>hot deployment</a> of new nodes and hot configuration change - this means it&#39;s not necessary to restart the running nodes. This greatly facilitates joining new validator and audit nodes to the network. Making all parts of the platform support hot configuration is a lot of work, so first the TCP transport was updated - this makes hot deployment of new nodes possible. This feature is ready to go to production.</p><p  class='text-p'>Research and planning is underway for proposals to increase the <strong>scalability</strong> of the network. Presently each node holds an open TCP connection to every other node, forming a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompleteGraph.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>complete graph</a>. This means every node&#39;s resource consumption increases in linear proportion to the size of the network. This is the easiest model to develop but naturally does not scale well. It is time to consider how the network can operate while a node maintains connections to only a subset of its peers. As a first step, this would involve the audit nodes. Terminology note: &quot;validator&quot; nodes participate in consensus (messages passed between these nodes are quite numerous and time-sensitive), whereas &quot;audit&quot; nodes do not participate in consensus and receive new blocks via the sync mechanism (less messages, are ok to take a little longer to reach).</p><p  class='text-p'>Lean Helix&#39;s new goroutine model is undergoing tests after extensive planning and development by <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a> and will be production-ready soon. It solves an inherent problem in the existing algorithm, where slow operations run by Lean Helix cannot be stopped by Leader Election or Node Sync events, even if these render the slow operation obsolete. This had a detrimental effect on liveness and performance of the platform. In the new goroutine model, Leader Election or Node Sync will immediately call the cancel function of the Go context of the slow operation, freeing Lean Helix to continue the consensus flow. Merging into orbs-network-go is underway (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1255" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1255</a>).</p><p  class='text-p'>Research and planning is underway for the concept of a <em>management chain</em> which the other virtual chains will connect to. More info in subsequent updates.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a> extracted the supervisor package of orbs-network-go into a separate <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/govnr" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>repo</a> called <strong>govnr</strong> (&quot;goroutine governor&quot;), so that orbs-network-go and lean-helix-go (and any other repo of course) can use supervised goroutines. The Go language does not allow <em>panic()</em> calls to propagate from one goroutine to another. This means a goroutine can die when <em>panic()</em> is called during its execution, thus rendering the node unusable without raising an alarm. The <em>supervised</em> package catches <em>panic()</em> calls, logs them, and tries to restart the goroutine. This is critical for infinitely-running goroutine such as those in the consensus, Node Sync, Transaction Pool and more.</p><p  class='text-p'>To facilitate testing, <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a> added the ability to set the clock time on Gamma (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1222" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1222</a>), similar to what is available on Ganache when developing over Ethereum.</p><p  class='text-p'>Elections timing was based on Ethereum blocks - every n blocks Elections were triggered. Ethereum block time is not constant, and is actually increasing over time, so it is proposed that Orbs platform switchis switching to time-based elections. This feature is being developed by <a href="https://github.com/noambergIL" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@noambergIL</em></a> (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-ethereum-contracts/pull/124" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#124</a>). Efficient testing of this significant update required the introduction of an all-Javascript integrative tests framework by <a href="https://github.com/ronnno" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@ronnno</em></a>, and setting the Gamma clock manually (which reduced test time from ~45s to 10-15s) by <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Significant progress made by <a href="https://github.com/itamararjuan" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@itamararjuan</em></a> (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1249" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1249</a>) in switching orbs-network-go and its dependencies from vendoring to Go Modules, along with upgrading to Go 1.12.6.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/IdoZilberberg" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@IdoZilberberg</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/itamararjuan" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@itamararjuan</em></a> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1257" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>resolved a long-standing bug</a> in Gamma tests, which would sometimes fail because one of the nodes would be left behind during consensus and never recover.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pulls/electricmonk" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@electricmonk</em></a> refactored the TCP transport code (<a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1241" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1241</a> <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1243/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>#1243</a>). A hard-earned refactoring tip: every time you spend any nonzero amount of time trying to understand the use of some object name or type, it becomes a candidate for rename. Same goes for any names that require comments to explain them - a short yet comprehensive list of naming guidelines can be found <a href="http://bensmith.io/20-tips-for-better-naming" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>.</p><p  class='text-p'>Gossip goroutine model change: <a href="https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1211" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go/pull/1211</a> - this increases resilience of the node - previously there was a single Goroutine per peer, meaning that if the current node&#39;s message connection to Lean Helix of some peer was blocked, there was also no connection available for forwarding transactions to that peer. The new update means Lean Helix, Transaction Forwarding, and other topics use separate goroutines and do not block one another.</p><p  class='text-p'>That&#39;s enough for one month!

<p  class='text-p'>---- SEPARATOR ----</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Research and Architecture</strong></p><p  class='text-p'><em>This segment was contributed by</em> <a href="https://github.com/avilanthe1" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><em>@Avilanthe1</em></a></p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs’ research efforts continue with researchers and developers work on different aspects of the Orbs blockchain infrastructure! Here is a breakdown:</p><p  class='text-p'>PoS Research</p><p  class='text-p'>Locking contract</p><p  class='text-p'>Last month, the PoS team’s main effort was to give a full specification of the locking contract. First, we distinguish between Validator locking and Delegator locking. In the past, our primary focus was solely on Validator locking, which was the first step towards a permission-less open-to-competition Validator nomination process. The addition of Delegator locking is an essential feature in the Orbs PoS architecture because we use periodic snapshots, which are susceptible to manipulation if no locking is employed. Additionally, locking would increase attack cost predictability - to attack the network one needs 70% of all delegated stake; without locking, there can be tremendous fluctuations in the amount of delegated stake, thus making the cost of an attack highly unpredictable.</p><p  class='text-p'>Our current planned locking contract architecture is composed of two separate contracts: one for Delegators and one for Validators. Each contract can be upgraded independently. Locking properties, such as locking periods and cool-down periods, may differ between the two contracts. Moreover, more than one locking options may be proposed to the different participants. Conditions for transferring locked coins from one contract to the other are specified. Furthermore, rewards and voting power are increased for locked coins versus unlocked coins.</p><p  class='text-p'>Zero-Knowledge</p><p  class='text-p'>The research team continually explores the subject of zero-knowledge proofs and its role in typical blockchain use cases. In the previous month, the effort focused on the following:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Offloading workload from user to cloud</strong>. Generation of proofs in zero-knowledge is often a significant computational effort, in some cases one that can&#39;t be performed (in a reasonable time) by a user who only uses their cellular phone rather than a powerful computer. Such a user may choose to offload the computation to the cloud, in which case they forfeit their privacy. To fix that, homomorphic encryption may be of use: a client may upload <em>encrypted</em> data to the cloud, which will generate the proofs directly from the encrypted data, thus not undermining the user&#39;s privacy. The research team is exploring this concept to check its feasibility and effectiveness.</li>
<li>Reference string generation. Numerous cryptographic systems entail a preprocessing phase in which a trusted or untrusted party generates what is referred to as a <em>common reference string</em>. For example, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash is such a cryptographic system. Having in mind that any future zero-knowledge-related application will probably require a reference string generation, the research team studied the generation process, with an emphasis on some parameter tweaking that may enable new and useful features. For example, the &quot;traditional&quot; way of generating the common reference string has a one-point failure: any one of the participating parties may fail the process if they so desire. Using ideas from distributed key generation schemes, we can mediate this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Proof of Custody</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs network employs a PoS design for Sybil resistance and to economically align the different parties with the protocol instructions. To steer clear of the “fox guarding the henhouse”-issue Orbs network utilizes Ethereum to perform Validators election (see more details <a href="https://www.orbs.com/pos-external-oversight/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>here</a>). For this reason, Orbs Ltd. operates an Ethereum node that is currently the provider of the election data to the Orbs network. This Ethereum node is effectively a single point of failure in the PoS architecture. Therefore, the research team is investigating different methods to resolve this issue to make the Orbs network more decentralized and by that more secure.</p><p  class='text-p'>One obvious “solution” can be to require all Validators to obtain their own Ethereum node. Unfortunately, Validators will have a hard time to comply with such a requirement as operating an Ethereum node incurs non-negligible costs as well as continuous and rigorous maintenance. Therefore, without a proper incentive, we cannot expect Validators to possess their own Ethereum node. Here is where Proof of Custody emerges - it enables Validators to prove succinctly that they hold specific data. In our case, such data can be the current Ethereum state which functions as a witness of one operating an Ethereum node. A proper proof of custody scheme involves proofs that are easy to compute, are of constant-size and can be verified quickly (preferably without interaction with the prover), as well as small size witnesses that can be easily validated in case of prover misbehavior.</p><p  class='text-p'>New Features Architecture</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs architecture and research team is extending the Orbs infrastructure by providing a detailed specification of the following new features and improvements:</p><p  class='text-p'>Trigger mechanism</p><p  class='text-p'>This feature enables contract calls that are self-triggered without necessitating an external client call. The trigger mechanism is a block-level hook - appended to the end of every block as a special system transaction. When executed, it triggers the execution of contract methods that were previously registered to the trigger mechanism and meet some predetermined conditions. At the outset, we design the trigger mechanism only to support other system services, some of which are mentioned below.</p><p  class='text-p'>Leader activity reputation</p><p  class='text-p'>This feature implements a simple failure detector intended to decrease the harm incurred to a virtual chain by a malfunctioning block proposer (mainly in terms of throughput).</p><p  class='text-p'>The idea is to record on-chain the activity of the block proposers as reflected in the consensus process. This activity is transformed into a measurable indicator called reputation. Validators reputation is taken into account at the beginning of each new consensus round, decreasing the chance of an inactive block proposer to get elected and vice versa.</p><p  class='text-p'>Management chain</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding the management chain transmutes Orbs infrastructure design from a simple collection of isolated (virtual) chains into a hierarchical one. Its primary purpose is to be a system-wide source of information to all other virtual chains in the Orbs network. As a first step, the management chain will be the sole maintainer of the Validator&#39;s election results, relayed from Ethereum. This solution reduces the resources consumed by Validator nodes, which currently have to relay the results on every virtual chain separately. In the future, the management chain could further serve as a trusted medium for virtual chain interoperability.</p><p  class='text-p'>Redesigning Ethereum mirroring</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs PoS data is maintained on Ethereum and relayed to the Orbs network by a mirroring agent. Currently, this process occurs in bursts - at every election event. A more reliable approach is to consume this data in small chunks continuously. The research team is working on a design that replaces the dedicated mirroring agent with the native trigger mechanism described above. Where the recording and processing of data on the Orbs management chain will be a system service.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>--- Separator---</strong></p><p  class='text-p'><strong>&lt;@Nate outro&gt;</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Till next time,</p><p  class='text-p'>Bella Ciao</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="../white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
