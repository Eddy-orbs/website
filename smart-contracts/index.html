</div><div class="flex-start smart-contracts-flex"><div class="text-with-title" data-aos="fade-up"><h5>contracts Registry</h5><div class="text-box-base-text limited-lines " style="-webkit-line-clamp:3"><p data-aos=fade-up>The contractRegistry manages the PoS contracts list and active managers. The contract is the basis of the system and allows any contract or user to retrieve the up-to-date contract lists.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>The contractRegistry pushes contract address updates to the PoS managed contracts. The contract registry is the core component of the PoS contracts upgrade and allows to transition to a new contract for each contract in the system, as well as the registry itself.</p>

The staking contract notifies the stakingContractHandler on any change in a participant stake, for example upon a stake or unstake actions.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>See: Orbs Staking Contract High-Level Specification</p>

<p data-aos=fade-up>The stakingContractHandler provides an infrastructure for connecting an additional staking contract or isolating the staking contract actions from the rest of the PoS contracts if needed.</p>

The delegation contract holds for participant his selected guardian and the participant’s self-stake as well as the stake delegated to the participant.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>On each change in a participant’s delegation, self stake or delegated stake, the contract notifies the stakingRewards contract that calculates the rewards accordingly. In addition, the delegations contract notifies the elections contract upon any change in a participant’s delegated stake, masking the delegator’s notation from the election contract.</p>
</div><button class="expend-btn" data-open="+ read more" data-close="- read less">+ read more</button></div><div class="text-with-title" data-aos="fade-up"><h5>elections</h5><div class="text-box-base-text limited-lines " style="-webkit-line-clamp:3"><p data-aos=fade-up>The election contract connects the delegation contract with the committee, guardians registration and certification contracts. In addition, the election contract implements the voting logic both for voteUnready and voteOut and manages the node state machine notification readyForCommittee and readyToSynct. Upon a notification from the delegation contract, the elections contract calculates the participant’s new effective stake and updates the committee contract.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>Upon a guardian’s readyForCommittee, the committee, the election contract validates that the guardian is registered and not voted-out and requests that the committee contract add it. If a guardian was voted-unready or voted-out, the elections contract requests that the committee contract remove it from the committee.</p>

The committee contract holds the current committee members and their weights. Upon an effective stake change notice from the election contract, the committee contract updates the committee member weight and emits an update event. On a request to join the committee, the committee member checks that the candidate is qualified to join.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>If the candidate’s weight is higher than the committee member with the lowest weight, the candidate will join the committee instead of the minimal weight guardian. Upon a change in the committee members list or their certification, the contact notifies the stakingRewards and FeesAndBootstrap contracts on the leaving and joining members to update their rewards state.</p>

The staking rewards architecture is based on the rewards per share architecture common in framing pools. The contract architecture was designed for the Orbs PoS architecture which is based on 3 levels: global allocation, committee guardians receiving their share based on their weight, and delegators receiving a portion of their guardian rewards based on their stake.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>The staking rewards contract is updated upon two events: an update to a delegator’s stake and a change in a guardian’s committee membership. A participant may claim his staking rewards that are staked in the staking contract and the system state is updated accordingly. The staking withdraws funds from the stakingRewardsWallet holds tokens up to the total unclaimed amount for all participants.</p>

The committee contract holds the current committee members and their weights. Upon an effective stake change notice from the election contract, the committee contract updates the committee member weight and emits an update event. On a request to join the committee, the committee member checks that the candidate is qualified to join.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>If the candidate’s weight is higher than the committee member with the lowest weight, the candidate will join the committee instead of the minimal weight guardian. Upon a change in the committee members list or their certification, the contact notifies the stakingRewards and FeesAndBootstrap contracts on the leaving and joining members to update their rewards state.</p>

The protocol wallets provide a simple, and thus secure, mechanism to store the protocol funds.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>The protocol wallets are disconnected from the PoS contracts governance and management infrastructure and are managed by two types of administrators: a functional administrator that sets the wallet’s client and a migration administrator that controls the withdrawal of funds.</p>

Two separate instances of fees wallets are deployed one for general virtual chains fees and one for certified virtual chains fees.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>The fees wallets store the subscription fees in 30 days buckets, to provide an accurate division of the fees for each time period. The two fees wallets client, the feesAndBootstrapRewards, collect the paid fees for the time period since the last collect.</p>

And allow guardians to register, modify their data and unregister. In addition the contact stores a metadata map allowing each guardian to store general purpose keys to be queried by the Orbs platform. For example, a link to the guardian identification data may be stored at the “ID_FORM_URL” metadata key. The guardiansRegistration provides mapping functions, such as from Orbs addresses to Ethereum addresses, used by other contracts to allow function calls using the Orbs address. The guardiansRegistration contract notifies the election contract on changes in guardians registration status.</p>

The certification data is managed by the certificationManager that may set and clear a guardian’s certification.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>The certification contract notifies the election contract on any change in a guardian certification.</p>

The contract allows developers to create a virtual chain, modify its properties, including metadata properties used by the Orbs platform, and extend a virtual chain subscription.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>Virtual chain creation and subscription extension are not done by directly interacting with the subscriptions contract but rather by calling the subscription plan contract that updates the subscriptions contract. The subscriptions contact holds a list of valid subscription plan contracts.</p>
</div><button class="expend-btn" data-open="+ read more" data-close="- read less">+ read more</button></div><div class="text-with-title" data-aos="fade-up"><h5>Subscription plan</h5><div class="text-box-base-text limited-lines " style="-webkit-line-clamp:3"><p data-aos=fade-up>The subscription plan contract is a stateless contract, responsible for the plan and fee structure of a virtual chain subscription. Virtual chain owners call the subscription plan contract to create a virtual chain and extend its subscription.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>The subscription plan contracts assigns a tier (plan) and the monthly fee rate based on the contract plan. Multiple subscription contracts may be deployed in the system.</p>

The protocol contact supports multiple deployment subsets, such as: production and canary, each may operate on the different protocol version. Upon protocol version upgrade, a future time is set as the cutoff date for the protocol upgrade.</p>
</div><button class="expend-btn" data-open="+ read more" data-close="- read less">+ read more</button></div></div><div class="smart-contracts-management"> <div class="text-with-title" data-aos="fade-up"><h5>Contracts Management and Governance Architecture</h5><div class="text-box-base-text"><p data-aos=fade-up>Orbs’ PoS contacts architecture is designed for future migration, including migration of individual contracts. Contracts in the PoS system that interact with other contracts store their current address in the contact storage. Upon a migration of a contract, the registry sends a push notification to all its managed contacts to update their contract list accordingly.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>In addition to the system contracts, the contract registry stores the up-to-date managers list. To ensure synchronization, the contacts query the registry on the current relevant manager before every governance operation.
Managers are appointed by the registryAdmin, which can appoint or revoke the role of a manager.</p>
<p data-aos=fade-up>The contract registry emits an update event for any contact address update as well as upon registry migration. By knowing the initial contract registry address, an application may track the up to date contracts list as well as construct an integrated event list from all the contract versions. An exception to contacts management by the contract registry are the protocol wallet contracts. The protocol wallet contracts have separate admins that manage their functionality and migration.</p>
