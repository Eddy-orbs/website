    >About SNAP</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the name of the formerly known Food Stamp Program. It is the US Department of Agriculture’s largest program, in terms of both money spent and number of recipients<a href="../#_ftn1" rel="noopener">[1]</a>. It provides food purchasing assistance to low income Americans. According to USDA’s data<a href="../#_ftn2" rel="noopener">[2]</a>, approximately 40 Million individuals of 20 Million households received SNAP in Fiscal Year 2018. The total cost to the US taxpayer is estimated at $65 Billion that year and the average monthly payout was about $125 per participant. Combining these with US household data<a href="../#_ftn3" rel="noopener">[3]</a>, suggests that 15.5%<a href="../#_ftn4" rel="noopener">[4]</a> of US households received SNAP support at some point in 2018. Astounding as it may be, it is still an improvement compared to 17.3% and 16.6% in Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017, accordingly, as shown in Table 1:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/solution-against-snap-fraud/Table-Individuals-households-and-total-Cost-of-SNAP-2016-2018-1030x282.png" alt="Table 1: Individuals, households and total Cost of SNAP 2016-2018"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>Participants in the program are issued with an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card which functions like an ordinary debit card, except that it can only be used to purchase authorized food items at specific retailers approved by SNAP. The EBT is recharged on a monthly basis with the amount that the participating household is eligible for.</p><h3 id="snap-fraud"  class='title-h3'
    >SNAP Fraud</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The most common abuse of SNAP is referred to as “trafficking”. It means an exchange of SNAP benefits for cash, unapproved items or other goods (<em>e.g.</em> controlled substances, firearms, ammunition, etc.). In some cases SNAP participants give away their EBT card in exchange for these benefits and then report that it is missing, in order to have a new one issued instead. Certain SNAP participants have outdone it by simply listing their EBTs on eBay and Craigslist<a href="../#_ftn5" rel="noopener">[5]</a>. In other cases, retailers are actively participating in the fraud. In those cases they usually charge the EBT with a certain amount in return for a discounted cash amount, or just overcharge the participant that is looking to purchase unapproved items.</p><p  class='text-p'>According to the recent SNAP State Activity Report<a href="../#_ftn6" rel="noopener">[6]</a>, $592.7 Million were determined by investigations as “Fraud Dollars” in 2016. One may assume that the amount suspected as fraud, though not “determined by investigations”, was higher. Thes “Fraud Dollars” stand for 0.8% of the overall cost of SNAP that year. While it may be debatable whether 0.8% of fraud is high or not, $592.7 Million of taxpayers money is a lot.</p><p  class='text-p'>This poses a double problem. First and foremost, families in need, especially those with children, or disabled or elderly participants, are deprived of the nutritional assistance they were intended to receive. Secondly, this malfunction motivates fraudulent activities on the expense of the federal aid funds.</p><h3 id="is-fraud-the-real-problem-with-us-social-programs-"  class='title-h3'
    >Is Fraud the Real Problem with US Social Programs?</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>It seems that SNAP fraud is frequently highlighted in the media, usually, in response to government campaigns warning against it and trying to stop it. Still, is fraud the <em>real</em> problem of US welfare programs?</p><p  class='text-p'>There are various federal and state social programs in the US. Each serves a unique purpose for meeting different basic needs, <em>e.g.</em> housing (Section 8 Housing), healthcare (Medicaid), nutrition (SNAP), cash assistance (TANF) and others. Different executive departments are responsible for different programs, with no single entity overlooking national welfare as a whole. This results in at least two undesired outcomes:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic overhead:</strong> Each program has to support its own administration. While it is difficult to determine to what extent each program’s administration overlaps with the others, it would be safe to assume that merging at least some of the overlapping divisions within these administrations under the responsibility of a single entity would improve overall efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Suboptimal national welfare assistance:</strong> Each program sets its own eligibility requirements. In order to receive the benefits of different programs, individuals are required to apply <em>separately</em> for each program. Multiple studies<a href="../#_ftn7" rel="noopener">[7]</a><a href="../#_ftn8" rel="noopener">[8]</a><a href="../#_ftn9" rel="noopener">[9]</a><a href="../#_ftn10" rel="noopener">[10]</a> suggest that this results in <em>eligible</em> individuals not applying for welfare due to the red tape involved, thus not getting the full support they should have. The result is a national welfare program that is not as efficient as it could and should be.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>It might be overly optimistic to assume that such an entity will be established any time soon in the US. However, a first step towards improving overall efficiency should be sharing some information across social programs and relevant executive departments. It can both decrease some of the bureaucratic overlap by improving data transparency and make it a lot easier for individuals to apply for different programs under this unified database.</p><h3 id="outlines-for-a-blockchain-based-solution"  class='title-h3'
    >Outlines for a Blockchain-based Solution</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In a nutshell, blockchain technology allows safe interactions between parties who do not necessarily trust each other. An example for such interaction is selective sharing of relevant information across multiple participating entities in the network. With regard to US welfare programs, this allows each participant in social program(s) to create her own digital identity (containing all her relevant personal details) combined with a cryptographic digital wallet, and share this information selectively with different programs, only as required. Naturally, this calls for the highest standards of data privacy, which will be discussed later on in this post.</p><h4 id="the-platform-works-as-follows-"  class='title-h4'
    >The platform works as follows:</h4>
<ul>
<li>John Smith plans on applying for a certain social program. For that purpose, he generates a digital ID and securely uploads all required documents. In addition, a set of digital wallet addresses is generated for John’s future use.</li>
<li>The application process is straightforward and requires John to provide a secure access to his digital ID to the program administration.</li>
<li>The program administration then determines whether he is eligible or not for the benefits. Upon his approval as eligible, one of his digital addresses is automatically assigned for receiving the benefits.</li>
<li>In addition, the approval means that his digital ID (<em>e</em> the documents he uploaded) is authenticated by a social program and can later be used for an easy application to any other social programs.</li>
<li>An <em>automated</em> process updates John from time to time on his eligibility for additional programs. Upon a match, John can simply apply for other program, by simply sharing his <em>already</em> authenticated digital ID.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Given that certain programs already provide benefits through EBT, the transition to a cryptographic digital wallet will be simplified. In fact, the participants will not notice any difference in their day-to-day use of EBT. Having said that, in order to maximize overall efficiency, more (and eventually all) programs should use the new cryptographic EBT with time. There are several advantages for the cryptographic wallet:</p><ul>
<li>It allows generating multiple addresses, all under the same master wallet, each for a different social program, if required</li>
<li>As additional programs use EBT, its importance increases for the participants. As a direct result, it is less likely that those individuals will tend to illegally exchange them for cash, thus a positive externality may be reduced SNAP trafficking</li>
<li>Lastly, as far-fetched as it may be right now, these cryptographic EBT wallets may possible serve as alternative bank accounts for individuals receiving social benefits and who are considered as “unbankable”</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Naturally, this is merely a general concept at a very preliminary phase.</p><h3 id="user-privacy"  class='title-h3'
    >User Privacy</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>The cornerstone of this conceptual platform is the guarantee of user privacy. Consequently, certain aspects in our suggested platform require special attention. Both aspects are mandatory for providing sufficient privacy:</p><ul>
<li>User identity - no documents will be stored on the platform, only their hashes will. This allows unequivocal authentication and user identification, without exposing <em>any</em> of the participant’s personal details. We will not go into the technicalities of hash functions herein.</li>
<li>Transaction anonymity - this part is a bit more complicated. We identify two types of users:<ul>
<li>Program administrations, who must get access to transaction details of their participants, in order to transfer benefits and enforce policy, <em>g.</em> which food items can or cannot be purchased, which retailers are part of the program or not, etc.</li>
<li>All other users, who should not get any type of other participants’ transaction data</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>This can be carried out using certain privacy protocols that mask the participant’s transaction in a way that only certain users can track it.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another aspect that we will not delve into at this point, but also requires attention, is improving EBT and digital ID access security. Obviously, the card itself along with the PIN code are not secure enough and as more programs use the new EBT, additional measures will be required to ensure they are not hacked. We have some concepts for overcoming this, and will further discuss them in future posts.</p><h2 id="conclusion"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Conclusion</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>There is no doubt that SNAP fraud is a hot topic that provokes a wider debate on US welfare program. In my opinion, a more interesting debate should focus on whether this is the <em>main</em> problem of the US welfare program. Either way, while the concept of a new blockchain-based solution might seem at first groundbreaking, in many key aspects it is based on upgrading current infrastructure (EBT) combined with new concepts (Digital ID). We consider it as another example in which blockchain technology inspires us to think outside the box about new solutions to old problems. In this particular case it may even kill two birds with one stone - both improving US welfare and curtailing fraud.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>Hexa Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on using blockchain to create social impact.

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
