    >Risks and rewards of liquidity farming</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Most popular DEXes are similar in concept to <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pairs" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Uniswap</a> and rely on the same risk/reward model. Some examples include <a href="https://app.sushi.com/farms/permanent" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>SushiSwap</a>, <a href="https://1inch.exchange/#/dao/pools?network=1" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>1inch</a> and <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/farms" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PancakeSwap</a>. To understand how their incentives work, digging into the Uniswap model is probably enough.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s assume we are providing liquidity on a ETH/USDC pool.</p><p  class='text-p'>The classic Uniswap incentives model for liquidity providers is based on 3 main parts:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Reward</strong> — Swap fees. Every time a trader performs a swap on the pool (swaps ETH to USDC or USDC to ETH in our example), liquidity providers are awarded a swap fee of 0.3%. This fee is divided pro rata and increases the value of the LP tokens each provider holds.</li>
<li><strong>Risk</strong> — Impermanent loss (IL). When a swap takes place, the price of the pair changes. Arbitrageurs usually work to mirror the external market price and are incentivized to continue swapping until the pool reflects it. As the price moves away from the point the liquidity provider entered, the liquidity provider accrues a loss. It is called “impermanent” because it is not made permanent until the provider removes liquidity, so if the price returns to the entry point, this loss disappears.</li>
<li><strong>Reward</strong> — Farming rewards. Projects often distribute their governance token (UNI/SUSHI/1INCH/CAKE) to liquidity providers to further incentivize them to participate. This reward is divided pro-rata and according to time — usually a small amount every block. Not all pairs usually participate, so this is very dependent on the current incentives program each project’s governance has chosen to give.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="is-being-a-liquidity-provider-always-profitable-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Is being a liquidity provider always profitable?</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>No. Since we have 2 main rewards and 1 main risk, it all depends on how they balance together. There are multiple factors at play here, like external market prices, how long the liquidity provider spent in the pool, the swap volume in the pool, total liquidity and so forth. Let’s go over some of them quickly:</p><ul>
<li>Trade volume — the more swap volume (people swapping through the pool), the more swap fees, better for the LP.</li>
<li>Price change — the more price change (in ETH/USDC for example, it doesn’t matter if ETH goes up or down), the more IL, worse for the LP.</li>
<li>Rewards/governance token price — if SUSHI goes up, farming rewards are more valuable, better for the LP.</li>
<li>Total liquidity — the more TVL (Total Value Locked), rewards distribute over more farmers so each one gets less, worse for the LP.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Generally speaking, the popular farming pairs like ETH/USDC are usually profitable for liquidity providers. Why? Because if they weren’t, there would be no liquidity in them.</p><h2 id="diving-into-impermanent-loss"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Diving into impermanent loss</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>We mentioned that IL stems from price change between the two tokens in the pair. In our ETH/USDC example, this happens when ETH goes up or down in price compared to USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>How would a liquidity provider experience IL?</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s say that on day 1, ETH price is $2000, and the LP adds 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC (adding liquidity must be balanced). On day 30, when the LP removes liquidity, ETH price is higher and is now $2500. When the LP exits, they would not receive their original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC back, instead they will receive 89.44 ETH and 223,606.80 USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>Is this good or bad? Since price of ETH moved, we know that it must be bad because we have IL. Let’s see how bad exactly:</p><p  class='text-p'>The total USD value on exit (89.44 ETH and 223,606.80 USDC with ETH at $2500) is $447,213.60. If the LP had never participated in the pool, and kept their original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC outside, the total USD value of their holdings would have been $450,000.00 (100 ETH and 200,000 USDC with ETH at $2500). This means the LP lost $2,786 which is about 0.62%.</p><p  class='text-p'>Is this a bad deal? Usually no, assuming swap fees and rewards earn much more than this 0.62% loss.</p><p  class='text-p'>The following table will help us explore IL as ETH price moves in various amounts (+25%, -25%, +50%, -50%, +75%, -75%):</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-2/1_8fucWsEI_LFkMZIZn31iLw-1030x242.png" alt=""></figure></p><h2 id="dividing-il-between-two-parties"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Dividing IL between two parties</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The concept we’re investigating in this series of posts is sourcing liquidity for ETH/USDC farming from two different parties — one party that provides the ETH and the other party that provides the USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>For discussion sake, let’s assume there are no swap fees, no farming rewards but ETH price changes — so we just have IL. How can we split IL between the two parties?</p><h3 id="strategy-1-all-il-on-the-eth-side"  class='title-h3'
    >Strategy 1 — all IL on the ETH side</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In our <a href="../single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-1" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we’ve seen that the different parties have different goals, so the risk does not necessarily have to be divided equally. The exciting parts of the Liquidity Nexus protocol actually come when things are asymmetric.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s try to make things completely asymmetric and make the ETH side responsible for all IL. This can make sense because DeFi players providing ETH can be offered higher portion of the rewards (higher APY) in exchange of taking more of the crypto volatility risk. CeFi players providing the USDC will compromise on lower rewards (lower APY), particularly if their exposure to crypto volatility is limited.</p><p  class='text-p'>How would that work in practice? Let’s go back to the numerical example from before. On day 1, ETH price is $2000. <em>Side A</em> supplies 100 ETH and <em>Side B</em> supplies 200,000 USDC. On day 30, when the sides want to remove liquidity, ETH price is higher and is now $2500. When the LP tokens are burned, instead of the original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC, we now have 89.44 ETH and 223,606.80 USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>If <em>Side B</em> does not suffer any IL, the fact that ETH price moved to $2500 should not affect it at all. Since our example only has IL and no rewards and no fees, <em>Side B</em> should withdraw exactly the 200,000 USDC it originally deposited. Since we have 223,606.80 USDC available on exit, after returning the 200,000, we have 23,606.80 USDC remaining. We will naturally use this remainder to compensate <em>Side A</em> as much as possible.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s run the numbers and compare to the table from before:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-2/1_3KFuTfgeVYL5l1FBxp-bA-1030x164.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>We can see that the IL for <em>Side A</em> is roughly doubled, which makes sense because only one side is taking on all of it. A different and interesting way of looking at this strategy is saying that <em>Side B</em> doesn’t actually really farm. Instead, <em>Side B</em> is giving a loan of USDC to <em>Side A.</em> But this loan is much more efficient than those available on Compound and Aave. The efficiency stems from the fact that the collateral doesn’t just sit there, it is actively farming and generating high yield. Since contracts will implement this behavior, we can allow <em>Side B</em> to reclaim their USDC at any time by automatically unwinding the LP position when they do so. In other words, even if the collateral is farming, there isn’t much added risk.</p><p  class='text-p'>Another interesting edge condition worth mentioning is what happens if ETH value drops by 75%. It is true that this is a bit extreme, but exploring the extremes helps us fine-tune the economics. In this case, you can see that <em>Side A</em>, that provided the ETH, loses all of its capital.</p><p  class='text-p'>Does this make sense? There’s no right or wrong answer. It may be justified by the following:</p><ul>
<li>If we look at this as a loan, it is normal to define boundaries where liquidations take place and expect the side risking liquidation to unwind the position before those happen. If <em>Side A</em> notices that ETH price starts dropping, they can reasonably be expected to withdraw before suffering major losses.</li>
<li>Our example is ignoring swap fees and rewards. In the majority of cases, swap fees alone are enough to counter IL. If this weren’t the case, all LPs would be losing money and nobody would provide any liquidity. If we add back the fees and rewards to this example, <em>Side A</em> would no longer be losing all of their capital.</li>
<li>This loss is impermanent, it only becomes permanent if liquidity is removed. If ETH dips by 75% in a short period of time, history so far showed that given enough time, it will bounce back. <em>Side A</em> can simply remain in position until this hopefully happens.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Nevertheless, you may not like this behavior, so we can tweak the algorithm slightly to avoid it and divide IL in a different way:</p><h3 id="strategy-2-il-on-eth-only-if-eth-goes-up"  class='title-h3'
    >Strategy 2 — IL on ETH only if ETH goes up</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Here’s another interesting alternative. Looking at the table of strategy 1, we can see that when ETH goes up, the model behaves nicely. The edge conditions come when ETH starts dropping, particularly to extremes of over 75%.</p><p  class='text-p'>What if the USDC side shares some of the IL in this case? This wouldn’t give it complete protection against crypto volatility, but will be able to protect the other side from serious losses.</p><p  class='text-p'>How would that work? If ETH goes up, we behave like in strategy 1. So let’s examine a case where ETH goes down with numbers in our previous example. On day 30, this time, when the sides want to remove liquidity, ETH price is lower and is now $1500. When the LP tokens are burned, instead of the original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC, we instead have 115.47 ETH and 173,205.08 USDC.</p><p  class='text-p'>Protecting <em>Side A</em> to the fullest in this case would maintain its principal of 100 ETH. This would leave extra 15.47 ETH which we can use to compensate <em>Side B</em> as it would incur a small loss. It’s an interesting question whether we want to keep this 15.47 ETH as ETH or swap it to USDC. On one hand, <em>Side B</em> prefers to work in USDC, so swapping makes sense. On the other hand, if ETH just dropped in price, this might be a bad time to sell. Let’s leave this question open for now.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s run the numbers and compare to the table from before:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-2/1_Blcfyf3fnoXXrnsFZVpvpw-1030x214.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>One of the things I like about this strategy is that it has a nice back story. We have to share the IL risk somehow, there’s no working around it. If ETH goes up in price, the ETH supplying side just made a lot of money — meaning they can bear the IL on themselves and keep a happy smile. If ETH goes down, the ETH supplying side is already in the red, so this is the time to share the pain. The added bonus for the USDC supplying side is that when this happens, they’re actually buying some ETH for a low price — and buying the dip has a great upside potential.</p><h3 id="strategy-3-splitting-il-down-the-middle"  class='title-h3'
    >Strategy 3 — splitting IL down the middle</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>For completeness, let’s also present the numbers we get if we were to split IL equally between the two parties. The calculation is quite simple and has a very nice air of symmetry about it.</p><p  class='text-p'>Back to our usual example.. On day 30, when the sides want to remove liquidity, ETH price is higher and is now $2500. When the LP tokens are burned, instead of the original 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC, we have 89.44 ETH and 223,606.80 USDC. <em>Side A</em> has a small loss over its principal of 100 ETH, and <em>Side B</em> has a small gain over its principal of 200,000 USDC. Can we find a number down the middle where both sides have the exact same loss over their principal?</p><p  class='text-p'>The magic number is taking exactly 24,845.2 USDC and swapping it to ETH. This will give us 99.38 ETH and 198,761.60 USDC. This means both sides now share a slight loss. How slight? Exactly 0.62% over their initial principal investment. This 0.62% figure should be familiar — this is exactly the IL that we had earlier when doing standard double-sided farming.</p><p  class='text-p'>Let’s run the numbers and compare to the tables above:</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/single-sided-farming-on-any-dex-via-orbs-liquidity-nexus-part-2/1_Zka4CQ79BqRR9Tmw7UFQxw-1030x164.png" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>This strategy is very symmetrical and this is indeed quite elegant, but I have to say that personally I don’t like it. When doing single-sided farming, the two parties are never equal. Forcing symmetry, though elegant, is not necessarily a good thing.</p><h2 id="summary"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Summary</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The purpose of this post was to show how we can implement different strategies to share IL between two parties engaged in single-sided farming together. Each of these strategies may appeal to some and has advantages and disadvantages.</p><p  class='text-p'>We’re not limited by these three alone. We can also mix them together and form interesting combinations, for example — take 50% of strategy 1 and 50% of strategy 3. So IL is not perfectly equal, but we do favor protecting the USDC side.</p><p  class='text-p'>We haven’t mentioned the rewards when discussing these strategies either. If farming together yields 40% APY in SUSHI reward tokens, we still have an open question of how to divide the rewards between the parties. It makes sense to assume that if IL is not shared equally, so won’t the rewards. Naturally, the party exposed to more risk should also reap higher rewards.</p><h2 id="learn-more"  class='title-h2 sub-title'

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
