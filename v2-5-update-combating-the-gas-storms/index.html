    >Orbs PoS: The Age of Guardians</h2>
<h2 id="-strong-executive-summary-strong-"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    ><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs Network launched in March 2019. With the growth of the Orbs ecosystem, the Orbs team launched the Beta version of V2 in July 2020.</p><p  class='text-p'>The V2 Beta has overall been a great success, with the vast majority of Guardians participating and over 1 Billion Orbs tokens staked. However, the period of the V2 Beta so far was also a very active period on Ethereum, largely due to the explosion in usage of DeFi protocols, which resulted in a significant spike in gas prices for using the Ethereum network. This created unanticipated issues that have required some additional development to solve.</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs development team is now releasing the V2.5 Update to address these new conditions.</p><p  class='text-p'>Main changes in V2.5:</p><ul>
<li>Reward distribution will be done on an ongoing basis by the protocol directly to both Guardians and Delegators, rather than in multiple transactions.</li>
<li>Guardians maintain control of the levels of distribution to their Delegators and can set these levels through the Tetra UI.</li>
<li>Rewards may be claimed at any time, and Guardians and Delegators may use the Tetra UI to do so.</li>
<li>Guardians will not have to do periodic automated reward distribution transactions.</li>
<li>Gas cost optimization for committee participation and other Guardian costs.</li>
<li>The reward calculation is accurate to the block level and accurately represents the Guardians participation in committee and delegators stake.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>In order to accomplish the above goals, V2.5 includes the following technical changes:</p><ul>
<li>Refactoring of the rewards contract.</li>
<li>Incorporation of technology inspired by yield farming contracts rewards allocation - a two-level mechanism designed to support Guardian and Delegator rewards.</li>
<li>The UI will now update the Guardian and Delegator on every stake or delegation change.</li>
<li>Simplification of the committee election logic for gas optimization, separating the committee members’ weight update and members list update.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Benefits:</p><ul>
<li>Significant reduction of Ethereum gas consumption across the Orbs Universe.</li>
<li>Simplification of the system by requiring less service in the nodes.</li>
<li>Reduction of node operation requirements by Guardians.</li>
<li>Added flexibility to the Guardians and Delegators, who may claim the staking rewards at any point in time.</li>
<li>Significant reduction in costs for Guardians.</li>
<li>Increased predictability and confidence for Delegators.</li>
</ul>

    ><strong>Post Beta PoS V2 Enhancements</strong></h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs Network launched in March 2019. With the growth of the Orbs ecosystem, the Orbs team launched a beta of V2 in July 2020.</p><p  class='text-p'>Orbs PoS V2 introduced a new architecture for the Orbs platform’s Guardians election, virtual chain provisioning and reward distribution, among other significant changes. The changes to the reward distribution model involved a shift from a manual, more centralized model for reward distribution to a decentralized model. This shift requires that rewards be distributed via smart contracts on Ethereum to a large number of participants with two different roles (Guardians and Delegators), which presents a technical challenge that requires innovative solutions.</p><p  class='text-p'>The solution planned for V2 was for the reward contract to distribute the rewards to the Guardians and then have the Guardians distribute to their Delegators using an automated service that would be incorporated into and run as part of their node. The rewards contract and distribution mechanism were tested as part of the V2 Beta testing period. During these tests, the system proved itself and executed successful distributions.</p><p  class='text-p'>However, while the Beta testing has been successfully completed, during this period there were also significant changes in the Ethereum ecosystem. The changes primarily relate to the explosion in usage of DeFi protocols, which resulted in a massive increase in ETH price and soaring gas prices.</p><p  class='text-p'>This in turn resulted in a significant increase in the costs incurred by Guardians when distributing rewards, beyond what was expected when the system was designed. The resulting feedback from participating Guardians led the team to rethink the architecture. Inspired by state of the art contract design patterns that are gaining popularity in yield farming contracts, the team designed a new architecture for V2 reward distribution. In addition, carefully analyzing the Beta testing behavior resulted in additional improvements being introduced to the contracts, and in particular in the committee election logic, pushing the gas consumption even lower.</p><h2 id="a-new-rewards-assignment-and-distribution-architecture"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >A New Rewards Assignment and Distribution Architecture</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The new reward distribution architecture provides a scalable and gas-efficient reward distribution that occurs through the protocol itself. This was accomplished by creating several updates to the V2 Beta architecture. Under the new system, Guardians still have the ability to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their Delegators, within the same parameters as provided for previously in V2. Guardians can set the level of rewards to be received by their Delegators through the Tetra interface. Guardians can change the reward distribution levels when they choose and their Delegators will be able to see the currently effective rate on the Tetra interface. However, once the level of distributions is set, the respective rewards are distributed by the protocol directly to both the Guardians and the Delegators, on a continuous basis. Delegators and Guardians can then decide when they wish to claim their reward tokens.</p><p  class='text-p'>This has several benefits. First, unlike the initial Beta rewards mechanism, which only managed rewards to the Guardians, the new rewards contract manages the rewards assignment for all participants - Guardians and Delegators. Assigning the Delegators’ rewards with the Ethereum rewards contract provides Orbs Delegators with an additional level of confidence and predictability for their rewards allocation. The on-chain rewards allocation also provides an accurate block level reward allocation for each participant that is updated on any change in the stake or delegation.</p><p  class='text-p'>The continuous reward assignment also allows Guardians and Delegators to control the rate at which they claim their rewards. Under the new architecture, a Participant can claim their rewards by sending a claim transaction to the contract. This may be done using the Tetra staking interface. As the claim transaction has a gas cost, Delegators may initiate these transactions based on their need and the current gas price, which fluctuates heavily. One of the main benefits of expanding the on-chain rewards allocation to include Delegators is eliminating the need for Guardians to periodically distribute the rewards to their Delegators, which has a high gas cost. Eliminating the periodic rewards distribution by Guardians also simplifies the Guardians’ nodes and reduces the chance for errors, for example due to non-sufficient ETH balance in a node wallet. Moreover, the on-chain rewards assignment eases the development of rewards analytics tools by the Orbs team and other ecosystem participants, enhancing the user experience.</p><h2 id="high-level-technical-overview"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >High-Level Technical Overview</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Inspired by the architecture for rewards assignment in yield farming contracts, the updated rewards contract provides the means for a scalable and continuously accurate rewards assignment. The basis for the mechanism is to update the minimal required parameters for every change in the state of a Delegator or Guardian.</p><p  class='text-p'>For example, when a Delegator makes a change in the state of the Delegator, their Guardian and the global state of the network will now be updated automatically. The ability to update only a small set of parameters, yet maintain a valid assignment for all participants, is achieved by constantly maintaining data on the global rewards for each Guardian’s effective stake and each Delegator&#39;s rewards per token for each Guardian. To keep the gas consumption low, the balance calculation is done only when a Guardian or Delegator claim their rewards; their exact assigned balance is then calculated based on the continuously updated state. The rewards allocation algorithm was designed to meet the Orbs PoS architecture’s requirement that there be a hierarchical Guardian - Delegator structure. In particular, the algorithm needs to award only committee members and their Delegators, and to take the Guardians’ effective stake into consideration. This required the team to design a new two-level architecture. Keeping the rewards allocation continuously updated is achieved by notifications from the Delegation contract and the Committee contract on relevant changes.</p><p  class='text-p'>In addition to rewards assignment refactor, additional changes in the contracts were made based on the Beta phase analysis. One of these changes includes a change in the committee election logic - a significant part of the model with an impact on both the operation of virtual chains and the assignment of rewards. The committee logic was modified to reduce the gas cost for the common cases, yielding a lower cost for the typical stake and delegation operations.</p><h2 id="gas-cost-analysis"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Gas Cost Analysis</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>To shed more light on the team&#39;s thought process that led to the change, let’s review the gas analysis for the reward distribution flow. In the Beta rewards distribution process, the Guardians were expected to periodically distribute the rewards, with a default distribution every 2 weeks. The fact that the Guardians were responsible for the distribution of rewards meant that the Guardians were required to distribute the rewards to the staking contract which updated the system state accordingly. This had a non-negligible gas cost.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Example - rewards distribution by a Guardian with 100 delegators.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Distributing rewards to 100 Delegators required to send multiple distributeRewards() transactions with a total gas cost of approximately 4M gas for each bi-weekly distribution. In some scenarios, the gas cost could further increase, for example, due to a Delegator’s change in their delegation just prior to the distribution.</p><p  class='text-p'>During the gas price storm in the last months, the gas price went from 10-30 Gwei in May all the way up to over 700 Gwei. The increase in gas cost, which was mostly due to the increased use of Defi applications on top of Etherium, remains high with an average of 200 Gwei gas price during the last month (see <a href="https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Etherscan</a>)</p><p  class='text-p'>This resulted in a distribution cost of 0.8 ETH, twice a month ( = 4M x 200 Gwei  = 0.8 ETH). Assuming an ETH price of $400, this would imply a $640 monthly cost for Guardians, which is much higher than the cost of operating the platform. Any additional surge in gas price or an increase in ETH price would increase the cost even further.</p><p  class='text-p'>The new architecture eliminates the Guardians rewards distribution flow, and with optimizations in the committee logic, has minimal impact on the staking gas cost. Controlling the cost of the system increases the robustness and sustainability of the PoS universe.</p><h2 id="what-s-next"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >What’s next</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The development of the new changes is complete but still requires reviews, testing and quality enhancements. In order to gain confidence in the new architecture, it is desired to open V2.5 in a Beta format and test it in action. The team plans to deploy the new contacts soon and start getting them in motion.</p><p  class='text-p'>As discussed, the change in the rewards architecture simplifies the analytics tools and UIs. As a first step, Tetra is being adjusted to accommodate the change and allow Guardians and Delegators to claim their deserved rewards at the click of a button.</p><p  class='text-p'>This process will require the Orbs team to extend the Beta period for V2, and V2 will not be launched in production during October 2020.</p><p  class='text-p'>However, these changes are crucial for the overall health and sustainability of the Orbs Universe. We aim to complete the update and conduct the final launch by end of November 2020.</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
