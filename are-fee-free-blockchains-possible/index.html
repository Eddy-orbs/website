Does it make sense? Can a fee-free blockchain be kept secure? What about spam?</p><p  class='text-p'>Kik’s intent is very simple. Just as it subsidises all its users’ operations over the Kik app, it wants to subsidise its users’ transactions over the blockchain. Basically, Kik is adopting the general policy of “subsidising all users’ activity” in the messenger app to the blockchain. Such attempts are very likely by any big app that aims at making micro-payments a common service that users follow regularly, like sending a message or a photo over to a friend.</p><p  class='text-p'>Kik planned to do this over Ethereum but found a surprisingly tricky fee mechanism. A transaction fee doesn’t seem to be determined according to the value transferred or in accordance with processing costs, but rather with supply and demand. When the “transaction demand” is high, fees go up; and when the “block gas supply” is high, fees go down. This resulted in unpredictability regarding the accumulated fees Kik would have to pay by the end of the month. Kik’s verdict — the fee structure is business infeasible for their use-case.</p><p  class='text-p'>Moving to Stellar, the situation seemed better, but there was still a significant vulnerability — a classic Sybil attack. The attack would work as follows. Transacting in the Stellar blockchain requires a minimal amount of XLM in the sending account. Kik, following its subsidising policy, would thus fund a small amount of XLM in each of its users’ wallets (a user accesses his wallet seamlessly from the Kik app, potentially not even aware the app is communicating with the Stellar blockchain). An abuser could then easily open many fictive Kik users, getting a small amount of XLM in each. Kik would have no simple means to distinguish abusers from real users. This was a death blow for the Stellar model for Kik.</p><p  class='text-p'>And so, Kik, for lack of choice, decided to build its own fee-free blockchain, which seems like the only valid decision they could make.</p><p  class='text-p'>So let’s try to understand — why are we paying fees in Bitcoin in the first place? Can we avoid them with a different blockchain design?</p><p  class='text-p'>The answer to the first question is quite clear — any platform that operates transactions and executes code has costs. Users pay fees in order to cover these costs. The catch is that in PoW-based blockchains, these costs are significantly governed by security costs rather than the cost of the actual resources (such as storage, compute and bandwidth) needed in order to process transactions. Put differently, users pay a significant fee in order to enjoy the security offered by PoW and the decentralization it enables. Just to be clear, in the “reward era” of PoW blockchains these fees come (mostly) in the form of inflation tax that miners collect (the core role of transaction fees is to incentivize miners to include transactions in blocks), while in the “post-reward era” transaction fees will have to do the work (check out this <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/CKWN-CCS16.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>paper</a> or this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08881.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>one</a> to gain some insight as to the “post-reward era” in Bitcoin).</p><p  class='text-p'>From a competitive standpoint, Bitcoin is not very attractive relative to centralized platforms that process transactions for much smaller fees. In these services, the core part of the fee serves as an insurance, which enables the companies managing these platforms have their users file complaints and get back stolen money. Today, there is no platform for transferring money that has no extra costs over the bare operational costs. With plain data such as text or photos this problem has been solved — the costs for sending a photo over the Internet has become negligible, enabling free-to-the-user data transfer services.</p><p  class='text-p'>What the crypto space (or at least a part of it) is trying to do is develop “cheap” consensus, where the operational costs reduce while the network is kept usable and trusted by the users. The famous Proof-of-Stake paradigm falls under this category, trying to preserve the same amount of security as PoW, while reducing security costs.</p><p  class='text-p'>A prominent approach for “cheap” blockchains rely on communication-based classic consensus protocols that have been developed in the distributed systems community for years. These protocols have been formally proven both safe (no forks are ever possible, not even temporary ones) and live (the chain keeps growing as long as messages are transferred as expected). These protocols have two main “catches” though. First, they take place among a given set of identified entities, and second they require a strict bound on the amount of Byzantine nodes, i.e., the amount of nodes that don’t behave as they are instructed by the protocol.</p><p  class='text-p'>If we believe “a given set of identified entities” can be decentralized enough and if we can assume the bound on Byzantine nodes holds, we can solve our “cheap” blockchain challenge. Maybe the system doesn’t have to be theoretically open (today, Bitcoin and Ethereum can’t claim to be practically open systems — becoming a profitable miner is an extremely complicated and expensive task). And maybe if the entities running the network are sufficiently diverse and frequently changed, then we still have a decentralized system. To assure the desired bound on the Byzantine nodes holds, we can include stake, <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>slashing conditions</a> and other incentivization techniques so that attacks feel as ridiculous and uneconomical as in PoW circumstances.</p><p  class='text-p'>To conclude, in the current state of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other PoW-based blockchains, fees are not paid to secure the network, inflation tax does that. Fees are paid in order to incentivize miners to include transactions in blocks. In the “post-reward era”, fees will have to cover security costs (as well as operational costs). The question of a feasible fee-free blockchain boils down to the possibility of a blockchain that is governed by a non-resource-wasteful consensus protocol such as <a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>PBFT</a>. Some people claim such solutions are already possible (e.g., utilizing <a href="https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10214/9769/Buchman_Ethan_201606_MAsc.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Tendermint</a> as the consensus layer of a DPoS architecture, or a reliable implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.01341.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Algorand</a>), others claim these are very far away and potentially inherently impossible or contradict real decentralization (check out this <a href="https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>work</a>, for example). It remains an open question and up for the general public to decide as these solutions come to maturity.</p><p  class='text-p'>As a side note, we in Orbs generally believe that “cheap” consensus is possible (<strong>you can read the</strong> <a href="https://orbs.site.strattic.io/white-papers/helix-consensus-whitepaper/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><strong>white paper for our Helix consensus here</strong></a>). We are not sure about PoS though. PoS-based chains give the political power of the system to the major currency holders (early investors, etc.). They will drive the system according to their interests, which are probably to increase the value of their tokens. This is not necessarily what’s best for the users. PoW-based chains, on the other hand, give much of the power to the miners — this was seen in SegWit, where Bitmain opposed the soft fork because of internal financial interests (as was claimed by Greg Maxwell and others, check out <a href="https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/asicboost-the-reason-why-bitmain-blocked-segwit-901fd346ee9f" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>this blog post</a>) and were able to delay the proposal significantly. Indeed, the users were able to activate SegWit and proved to be a significant political power in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is clear now that miners’ interests are not aligned with those of the users, which is a very unhealthy property of the system.</p><p  class='text-p'>We believe it makes more sense to put the political power in the hands of app developers that run their apps on top of the blockchain. They have a clear incentive to process transactions and keep the operation costs to a bare minimum while not sacrificing security. They probably best represent the users, which we cannot expect to be active and aware of economical/technical issues as the space scales to mass consumption (as Bitcoin users today are).</p></div></div></div><div class="single-blog-bottom"><h3 class="single-blog-bottom-title">Get involved</h3><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex flex-between"><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/logo.svg" alt="orbs logo"/><h4>White papers</h4><a href="../white-papers" target="_blank">Read the Orbs white papers</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/github.svg" alt="github icon"/><h4>GitHub Repo</h4><a href="https://github.com/orbs-network" target="_blank">Review the code &amp; contribute</a></div><div class="single-blog-bottom-flex-item flex-column"><img src="../assets/img/blog-inner/documents.svg" alt="document icon"/><h4>Documentation</h4><a href="/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians" target="_blank">Developer documentation</a></div></div></div></main><div class="subscribe" style="display:none"><section class="subscribe-overlay"></section><form class="subscribe-form form"><button type="button" class="form-close-btn" aria-label="Close"><img src="../assets/img/common/close.svg" alt="close"/></button><h3 class="form-title">SUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES</h3><div class="form-content flex-column"><div class="form-success" style="background:#191919"><p  class='text-p'>Amazing!

Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'

<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
