With a few simple steps, Delegators can significantly reduce losses incurred by these high gas prices.</p><p  class='text-p'>In this guide, we will explain how Delegators can perform their roles as Orbs Delegators in a more efficient manner and thereby significantly reduce costs associated with gas prices.</p><p  class='text-p'>But first, a short background on the Orbs proof of stake architecture on Ethereum.</p><h2 id="orbs-the-hybrid-blockchain"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Orbs the hybrid blockchain</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs project introduced a novel and original model of a hybrid blockchain:</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs network is its own PoS-based blockchain that is used as an infrastructure for running applications. Part of its design provides for stable transaction fees. By running their applications on a virtual chain on the Orbs network, applications are insulated from the fluctuations of gas prices in Ethereum, where they have to compete with others for resources. Orbs is therefore not a layer 2 for Ethereum and it holds its own value in its permissionless validator pool based on the PoS ecosystem of the ORBS token and its incentives model.</p><p  class='text-p'>However, Orbs network utilizes the Ethereum network to accommodate the ORBS ERC20 token and Proof-of-Stake contracts. The ORBS token is used for paying infrastructure fees, running apps and also for staking, electing Guardians and rewarding the PoS participants. Orbs PoS Ethereum contracts implement the logic for staking tokens, electing the Guardians committee, distributing rewards and fees and provisioning Orbs virtual chains. Orbs ecosystem participants, Delegators and Guardians, interact with the PoS contracts by sending Ethereum transactions to the relevant Orbs contracts, these transactions are subject to gas cost.</p><p  class='text-p'>The choice to delegate the voting functions to Ethereum was made because it provides an <strong>external objective guarantee</strong> that any observer can verify that elected nodes on Orbs are indeed the ones the stakeholders voted for. Similarly, launching the Orbs token as an ERC20 token allows the Orbs token to enjoy the security benefits provided by Ethereum’s robust security ecosystem. For these important functions, Ethereum is a crucial component in the Orbs design.</p><p  class='text-p'>This voting feature’s logic is explained in this excellent blog by Orbs co-founder, Tal Kol,:</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/pos-external-oversight/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/optimizing-ethereum-gas-costs-for-orbs-delegators/photo_2021-01-05_17-04-50.jpg" alt=""></figure></a></p><p  class='text-p'>This structure allows the Orbs network to enjoy many of the benefits of both chains. However, the parts of the Orbs network that rely on Ethereum are still subject to some of Ethereum’s downsides. Thus, while applications running on top of Orbs are shielded from gas price fluctuations, the distribution of rewards on the Ethereum blockchain can be affected. Overall, the security and objectivity benefits outweigh these downsides, and the design has been streamlined in order to mitigate them to the extent possible.</p><h2 id="v2-5-update-combatting-the-gas-storms"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >V2.5 update - Combatting the gas storms</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs PoS V2.5: The Age of Guardians architecture takes Orbs’ PoS over PoW design to the next level by moving the entire election logic and reward mechanism to be performed by Ethereum smart contracts.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more, see the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs PoS V2.5 Overview Document</a></p><p  class='text-p'>The period of the Orbs PoS V2 Beta, was also a very active period on Ethereum, largely due to the explosion in usage of DeFi protocols, which resulted in a significant spike in gas prices for using the Ethereum network. This created unanticipated issues that required some additional development to solve.</p><p  class='text-p'>As noted above, high gas costs adversely affect some aspects of the Orbs Network operation, specifically transactions which are executed using Ethereum smart contracts, such as staking.</p><p  class='text-p'>As a consequence, the Orbs team released the V2.5 update which, with remarkable innovation and sophistication, successfully managed to reduce the Ethereum gas consumption across the entire Orbs PoS Universe. It accomplished this by, among other things, allowing Delegators to claim their rewards directly from the protocol, instead of having the rewards sent to the Guardians first. This cut the number of transactions for which gas prices need to be paid in half <strong>and allowed the Delegators to choose when and how often to initiate these transactions.</strong> We’ll see why this is important later on.</p><p  class='text-p'>To read more about the V2.5 update release, see here:</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/v2-5-update-combating-the-gas-storms/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/optimizing-ethereum-gas-costs-for-orbs-delegators/photo_2021-01-05_17-07-44.jpg" alt=""></figure></a></p><h2 id="gas-costs-efficiency-for-delegators"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Gas costs efficiency for Delegators</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>In the last couple of days, we experienced another substantial increase in activity on the Ethereum network. This caused the network to congest which in turn brought a spike in gas prices. These spikes, or “gas storms”,  tend to be short-lived and are usually caused by market conditions such as high volatility, etc.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1346054016493645824" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/optimizing-ethereum-gas-costs-for-orbs-delegators/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-15.15.27.png" alt=""></figure></a></p><p  class='text-p'>With the recent increase in the price of ETH, gas prices can become hefty, even up to $50. Such events affect the entire Ethereum ecosystem, not only Orbs, as can be seen in the below example. And yet, Ethereum still has the strongest ecosystem due to its many benefits which make it very attractive for developers and projects.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1345987750319812609" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/optimizing-ethereum-gas-costs-for-orbs-delegators/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-13.44.27-691x1030.png" alt=""></figure></a></p><h2 id="three-basic-functions"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Three basic functions</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Such high gas fees can inflict heavy costs on Orbs Delegators when executing transactions on Ethereum smart contracts if they are not careful and strategic. In general, Orbs Delegators need to execute 3 basic functions, all of which can be done using the <a href="https://staking.orbs.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Tetra</a> staking wallet</p><h4 id="1-stake"  class='title-h4'
    >1) Stake</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Stake ORBS tokens to an Orbs Guardian and receive staking rewards.</p><h4 id="2-unstake"  class='title-h4'
    >2) Unstake</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>To unstake staked ORBS token, which can then be withdrawn after a 14 days cooldown period.</p><h4 id="3-claim-rewards"  class='title-h4'
    >3) Claim Rewards</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>To move ORBS tokens received as part of the staking rewards into the staking contract. <strong>A Delegator’s rewards are safely maintained in his rewards construct balance until claimed.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Regarding the first 2 functions, the choice to initiate them depends on the Delegators’ personal considerations and can be timed accordingly. <strong>The Orbs team recommends that Delegators check current gas prices (and all other aspects of their transactions) carefully before initiating any transaction</strong>.</p><p  class='text-p'>A good website to view the current recommended gas prices is <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ETH GAS STATION</a>, or <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Etherscan</a></p><h3 id="the-claim-rewards-transaction-is-a-different-story-"  class='title-h3'
    >The “Claim Rewards” transaction is a different story.</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Claiming rewards gives very little value to Delegators and should rarely be done. The main value of claiming is that the election weight of the Delegator&#39;s Guardian is adjusted to count for the reward. This change is normally negligible for the average Delegator, and will not influence election results. In addition, as mentioned above, <strong>the rewards belong via contract to the Delegator whether or not they are claimed</strong>, and can be claimed at any time.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Therefore, It&#39;s recommended to claim very rarely, or perform it only as part of the unstake flow.</strong></p><h2 id="conclusion"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Conclusion</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>All in all, under normal circumstances, Orbs Delegators rarely need to do actions that result in paying gas fees on the Ethereum Network. A Delegator that is satisfied with his Guardian may need to initiate only a handful of transactions a year which can be timed with low gas fees.</p><p  class='text-p'>These costs are compensated for by the benefits of working over the Ethereum Blockchain which provides the necessary security and oversight required to maintain the integrity of the Orbs network.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>This is the second guidebook to the Orbs Delegator issued following the release of Orbs PoS V2.5: The Age of Guardians.</p><p  class='text-p'>The first one offered general guidelines for the Orbs Delegator on how to choose a Guardian.

    >Orbs Push into DeFi</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>In the past couple of months, the Orbs project has been pushing hard into the DeFi space, with the biggest step so far being the announcement of the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/introducing-orbs-liquidity-nexus-liquidity-as-a-service/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Liquidity Nexus</a>,  Orbs’ newest DeFi project,  aiming to enable single-sided yield farming on leading venues. The main idea of DeFi is that every contract is interoperable with every other contract. Since all contracts are pure code with well-defined API’s, working together is easier than ever.  In the new DeFi world, all a developer needs to do is take a look at the contract’s API available to anyone on-chain, and start developing straight away.</p><p  class='text-p'>Having a strong presence on popular cloud infrastructures makes this process easier than ever, and is another important step for attracting developers towards the Orbs ecosystem.</p><h3 id="learn-more"  class='title-h3'
    >Learn More</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs is a permissionless, open-source blockchain infrastructure project. Blockchain allows communities to collaborate on running systems together, we see this as the next step beyond open source. A critical part of adoption is a hands-on experience by the developers themselves. Creating an optimal developer environment and tools is one of our top priorities.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more about developing on Orbs, hop on to <a href="https://docs.orbs.network" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>https://docs.orbs.network</a></p></div></div></div><div class="blog-element" data-url="../when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system" data-image="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/bg.jpg" data-title="When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System" data-prefix="On" data-date="May 5, 2021"><div class="single-blog-header"><h1 class="single-blog-header-title">When Decentralized Finance Meets the Traditional System</h1><div class="single-blog-header-author-flex"><div class="single-blog-header-author flex-start"><section class="blog-author-details flex-start"><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/team/members/small/NettaKorin.jpg" alt="Netta Korin"></figure>

Had someone predicted any of the above only a few months ago (let alone more than a year ago...), she may have been laughed off of her blog...</p><p  class='text-p'>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is one of the main pillars of this trend, reaching a record of over $60B in total value locked (TVL) by mid-April 2021 with an endless stream of new ideas, solutions and funding. In a <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">previous post</a>, we discussed the opportunity that DeFi may hold for the unbanked, based on the critical role of stablecoins. Since then (October 2020) TVL has increased fivefold. A staggering pace indeed.</p><p  class='text-p'>In many respects, the traditional financial platform and the DeFi ecosystem are parallel universes. Both provide a plethora of financial services and instruments for investors with a growing similarity. Usually, the DeFi universe is inspired by traditional finance services,  and creates an updated version of those services on steroids, <em>e.g.</em> yield farming and flash loans. While each universe works quite well on its own, problems emerge when trying to migrate from one to the other. In this post, we discuss some of these issues. For convenience matters, we will use the terms Fiat and Crypto markets to denote the traditional financial system (Centralized finance or CeFi) and DeFi, respectively.</p><p  class='text-p'>Migrating from Fiat to Crypto gets less challenging everyday. More and more service providers, <em>e.g.</em> exchanges, brokers, etc. allow purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards and bank transfers. These conversions involve significant fees, much higher than those involved in FX conversion or even buying stocks, but this is likely to diminish with time as competition grows. The main barrier is still the common notion that “it is complicated” and requires advanced skills and knowledge. While it does require both, so did opening a bank account 50 years ago. Let me assure you that anyone who’s willing to spend a brief few hours reading about it can successfully accomplish this task. Those who do not will just have to wait until banks start providing this service. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/us-bank-details-new-cryptocurrency-offerings.html" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Some already do</a>, and my guess is that many more will follow.</p><p  class='text-p'>The real difficulty lies in the opposite direction. In fact this process can be excruciating for businesses and individuals due to the conservative nature of banks, persistent in their unwillingness to accept funds originating in cryptocurrency activities. In Israel for example, blockchain companies were charged by the tax authorities on their crypto profits, but many of them were unable to repatriate funds in order to pay the taxes they were charged!</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/when-decentralized-finance-meets-the-traditional-system/E0TCCctXsAA7xGQ-1030x687.jpeg" alt=""></figure></p><p  class='text-p'>To be fair, banks are not the ones to blame, as they are not the source of the problem, only its agents who face the frustrated customers. Most governments and regulators set (at best) partial, and usually no, AML and KYC regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Consequently, banks lack clear instructions on how they should handle these funds, while at the same time they bear full legal liability for their <em>sources</em>. Naturally, this lack of clarity puts them in an awkward position and practically leaves them with only two choices. They could either establish an elaborate strategy and internal guidelines for analyzing such fund sources and ultimate beneficial owners, or they could refuse to accept them. Three guesses which is the most popular choice, and the first two guesses don&#39;t count.</p><p  class='text-p'>Adding to that is the sad truth that cryptocurrencies are sometimes used by malicious actors, whether on the Darknet or other channels, in order to finance illegal activities. In that sense, it is highly demoralizing that DeFi provides them with new potent financial instruments to manage their funds more efficiently. As we explained in a previous post, DeFi allows the unbanked to participate in the financial system due to the ease of generating and managing a digital wallet. The downside is that malicious actors benefit from that as well, by getting a powerful technology to easily bypass strict AML regulations.</p><p  class='text-p'>To recap this point, potential DeFi investors must take into consideration that it might take <em>a while</em> before they are able to cash out profits from their bank account. How much is “a while”? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p  class='text-p'>Therefore, it is obvious that governments must move faster towards regulating crypto. Parts of it would rely on existing AML and financial compliance concepts, only adapted to the new market with its new challenges. Other parts may require an overhaul and a re-evaluation of which methodologies are still relevant and can be applied differently and which ones are outdated and should be updated. It is no surprise that tools that provide chain analysis, sanction compliance, financial crime prevention and more are already available. Naturally new regulation is never an easy task, however, it can and should be a differentiator between regulators who stand to the challenge and are looking to adapt in face of innovation, and those who prefer to follow and lag behind.</p><p  class='text-p'>The key advantage of adopting new regulations is taxes, which actually withholds two benefits. The first and trivial one is straightforward - new regulation will attract new entrepreneurs, companies and investors who will generate new financial activity, thus new taxes. The other one is a bit more subtle. As this activity lacks proper regulation, most investors cannot declare their profits and be taxed accordingly. Proper regulation could release them from this situation, into which they were forced. We can only assume that the lion&#39;s share of investors is law-abiding citizens who would opt-in to being legally taxed rather than having to bear with unknown consequences of alleged non-voluntary tax evasion. Needless to say that both benefits would only intensify as more enterprises are involved in the Crypto market.</p><p  class='text-p'>To sum it all up, I strongly believe that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are already on a clear path towards adoption by mainstream enterprises and governments. Therefore regulators must be as responsive as they can to support and accommodate the financial system. They will have to do their best to adopt, improve and develop AML and other financial compliance methodologies. It is a difficult task as regulators are conservative, and in certain situations, they definitely should be, thus they require time to analyze and predict all potential directions that markets are going to. The problem is that these markets are driven by skilled entrepreneurs, who cannot and will not wait, but will rather keep pushing the envelope towards innovation and new solutions. Regulators will have to do their best to keep up with them.</p><p  class='text-p'>My estimation is that with time both universes will consolidate into a single one. When that happens we could all reminisce about the good old days before there were digital USD, Euro or Yuan and you couldn’t even pay with your digital wallet at the supermarket. Even though I can’t tell when those days will come, I am sure that the future of this industry will be anything but boring.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Netta Korin</strong> is a cofounder of Orbs.  Prior to Orbs Netta worked for many years on Wall Street as a hedge fund manager.  She later held senior positions in the Israeli government, including Senior Advisor in the Israeli Ministry of Defense to General Yoav (Poly) Mordechai, Head of CoGAT, and Senior Advisor to Deputy Minister Dr. Michael Oren in the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel, focusing on Palestinian issues.
