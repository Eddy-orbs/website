With a few simple steps, Delegators can significantly reduce losses incurred by these high gas prices.</p><p  class='text-p'>In this guide, we will explain how Delegators can perform their roles as Orbs Delegators in a more efficient manner and thereby significantly reduce costs associated with gas prices.</p><p  class='text-p'>But first, a short background on the Orbs proof of stake architecture on Ethereum.</p><h2 id="orbs-the-hybrid-blockchain"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Orbs the hybrid blockchain</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>The Orbs project introduced a novel and original model of a hybrid blockchain:</p><p  class='text-p'>The Orbs network is its own PoS-based blockchain that is used as an infrastructure for running applications. Part of its design provides for stable transaction fees. By running their applications on a virtual chain on the Orbs network, applications are insulated from the fluctuations of gas prices in Ethereum, where they have to compete with others for resources. Orbs is therefore not a layer 2 for Ethereum and it holds its own value in its permissionless validator pool based on the PoS ecosystem of the ORBS token and its incentives model.</p><p  class='text-p'>However, Orbs network utilizes the Ethereum network to accommodate the ORBS ERC20 token and Proof-of-Stake contracts. The ORBS token is used for paying infrastructure fees, running apps and also for staking, electing Guardians and rewarding the PoS participants. Orbs PoS Ethereum contracts implement the logic for staking tokens, electing the Guardians committee, distributing rewards and fees and provisioning Orbs virtual chains. Orbs ecosystem participants, Delegators and Guardians, interact with the PoS contracts by sending Ethereum transactions to the relevant Orbs contracts, these transactions are subject to gas cost.</p><p  class='text-p'>The choice to delegate the voting functions to Ethereum was made because it provides an <strong>external objective guarantee</strong> that any observer can verify that elected nodes on Orbs are indeed the ones the stakeholders voted for. Similarly, launching the Orbs token as an ERC20 token allows the Orbs token to enjoy the security benefits provided by Ethereum’s robust security ecosystem. For these important functions, Ethereum is a crucial component in the Orbs design.</p><p  class='text-p'>This voting feature’s logic is explained in this excellent blog by Orbs co-founder, Tal Kol,:</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/pos-external-oversight/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/optimizing-ethereum-gas-costs-for-orbs-delegators/photo_2021-01-05_17-04-50.jpg" alt=""></figure></a></p><p  class='text-p'>This structure allows the Orbs network to enjoy many of the benefits of both chains. However, the parts of the Orbs network that rely on Ethereum are still subject to some of Ethereum’s downsides. Thus, while applications running on top of Orbs are shielded from gas price fluctuations, the distribution of rewards on the Ethereum blockchain can be affected. Overall, the security and objectivity benefits outweigh these downsides, and the design has been streamlined in order to mitigate them to the extent possible.</p><h2 id="v2-5-update-combatting-the-gas-storms"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >V2.5 update - Combatting the gas storms</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Orbs PoS V2.5: The Age of Guardians architecture takes Orbs’ PoS over PoW design to the next level by moving the entire election logic and reward mechanism to be performed by Ethereum smart contracts.</p><p  class='text-p'>To learn more, see the <a href="https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Orbs PoS V2.5 Overview Document</a></p><p  class='text-p'>The period of the Orbs PoS V2 Beta, was also a very active period on Ethereum, largely due to the explosion in usage of DeFi protocols, which resulted in a significant spike in gas prices for using the Ethereum network. This created unanticipated issues that required some additional development to solve.</p><p  class='text-p'>As noted above, high gas costs adversely affect some aspects of the Orbs Network operation, specifically transactions which are executed using Ethereum smart contracts, such as staking.</p><p  class='text-p'>As a consequence, the Orbs team released the V2.5 update which, with remarkable innovation and sophistication, successfully managed to reduce the Ethereum gas consumption across the entire Orbs PoS Universe. It accomplished this by, among other things, allowing Delegators to claim their rewards directly from the protocol, instead of having the rewards sent to the Guardians first. This cut the number of transactions for which gas prices need to be paid in half <strong>and allowed the Delegators to choose when and how often to initiate these transactions.</strong> We’ll see why this is important later on.</p><p  class='text-p'>To read more about the V2.5 update release, see here:</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://www.orbs.com/v2-5-update-combating-the-gas-storms/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/optimizing-ethereum-gas-costs-for-orbs-delegators/photo_2021-01-05_17-07-44.jpg" alt=""></figure></a></p><h2 id="gas-costs-efficiency-for-delegators"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Gas costs efficiency for Delegators</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>In the last couple of days, we experienced another substantial increase in activity on the Ethereum network. This caused the network to congest which in turn brought a spike in gas prices. These spikes, or “gas storms”,  tend to be short-lived and are usually caused by market conditions such as high volatility, etc.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1346054016493645824" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/optimizing-ethereum-gas-costs-for-orbs-delegators/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-15.15.27.png" alt=""></figure></a></p><p  class='text-p'>With the recent increase in the price of ETH, gas prices can become hefty, even up to $50. Such events affect the entire Ethereum ecosystem, not only Orbs, as can be seen in the below example. And yet, Ethereum still has the strongest ecosystem due to its many benefits which make it very attractive for developers and projects.</p><p  class='text-p'><a href="https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1345987750319812609" rel="noopener" target='_blank'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/optimizing-ethereum-gas-costs-for-orbs-delegators/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-13.44.27-691x1030.png" alt=""></figure></a></p><h2 id="three-basic-functions"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Three basic functions</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>Such high gas fees can inflict heavy costs on Orbs Delegators when executing transactions on Ethereum smart contracts if they are not careful and strategic. In general, Orbs Delegators need to execute 3 basic functions, all of which can be done using the <a href="https://staking.orbs.network/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Tetra</a> staking wallet</p><h4 id="1-stake"  class='title-h4'
    >1) Stake</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>Stake ORBS tokens to an Orbs Guardian and receive staking rewards.</p><h4 id="2-unstake"  class='title-h4'
    >2) Unstake</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>To unstake staked ORBS token, which can then be withdrawn after a 14 days cooldown period.</p><h4 id="3-claim-rewards"  class='title-h4'
    >3) Claim Rewards</h4>
<p  class='text-p'>To move ORBS tokens received as part of the staking rewards into the staking contract. <strong>A Delegator’s rewards are safely maintained in his rewards construct balance until claimed.</strong></p><p  class='text-p'>Regarding the first 2 functions, the choice to initiate them depends on the Delegators’ personal considerations and can be timed accordingly. <strong>The Orbs team recommends that Delegators check current gas prices (and all other aspects of their transactions) carefully before initiating any transaction</strong>.</p><p  class='text-p'>A good website to view the current recommended gas prices is <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>ETH GAS STATION</a>, or <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Etherscan</a></p><h3 id="the-claim-rewards-transaction-is-a-different-story-"  class='title-h3'
    >The “Claim Rewards” transaction is a different story.</h3>
<p  class='text-p'>Claiming rewards gives very little value to Delegators and should rarely be done. The main value of claiming is that the election weight of the Delegator&#39;s Guardian is adjusted to count for the reward. This change is normally negligible for the average Delegator, and will not influence election results. In addition, as mentioned above, <strong>the rewards belong via contract to the Delegator whether or not they are claimed</strong>, and can be claimed at any time.</p><p  class='text-p'><strong>Therefore, It&#39;s recommended to claim very rarely, or perform it only as part of the unstake flow.</strong></p><h2 id="conclusion"  class='title-h2 sub-title'
    >Conclusion</h2>
<p  class='text-p'>All in all, under normal circumstances, Orbs Delegators rarely need to do actions that result in paying gas fees on the Ethereum Network. A Delegator that is satisfied with his Guardian may need to initiate only a handful of transactions a year which can be timed with low gas fees.</p><p  class='text-p'>These costs are compensated for by the benefits of working over the Ethereum Blockchain which provides the necessary security and oversight required to maintain the integrity of the Orbs network.</p><p  class='text-p dots'>&middot;&middot;&middot;</p><p  class='text-p'>This is the second guidebook to the Orbs Delegator issued following the release of Orbs PoS V2.5: The Age of Guardians.</p><p  class='text-p'>The first one offered general guidelines for the Orbs Delegator on how to choose a Guardian.

My years of experience as a donor and as an advisor in the Israeli government helped fuel within me the desire to fix a system that is clearly broken on a global level. It is common, and in fact, silently acceptable, that international aid funds go astray, and, in our neighborhood, even funding terror instead of providing much-needed humanitarian aid.</p><p  class='text-p'>Recently I <a href="../tracking-gaza-terror-funding" rel="noopener">discussed</a> how blockchain technology can be used to track humanitarian aid to Gaza in order to prevent aid dollars from reaching terrorist organizations. . The largest single provider of international aid funds to Gaza over the last decade has been Qatar. In this piece I would like to detail their giving, and show how, combined with our solution, we could potentially create a mechanism that will alter the way in which international institutions distribute aid, and create transparency and accountability.</p><p  class='text-p'>Some background: Since 2008, Israel and Hamas have had three armed conflicts, the most recent of which was in May 2021. With Israel’s consent, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/.premium-with-israel-s-consent-qatar-gave-gaza-1-billion-since-2012-1.6917856" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Qatar provided Gaza with over $1 Billion from 2012 to 2018.</a> Within a few weeks of the end of the last conflict, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-families-begin-receiving-qatari-aid-payments/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>Qatari fund flow was renewed</a>, again with Israel’s consent. However, history has shown that over <a href="../tracking-gaza-terror-funding" rel="noopener">$1.25 Billion of funds</a> have sadly been siphoned to Hamas for terror financing, and thus did not achieve the humanitarian purpose. This is tragic for many reasons, but also because of the fact that 80% of Gazans rely on these aid funds. Therefore, it should be of global interest to optimize the distribution procedure and make it as smooth, secure and transparent – as possible. Smooth, in order to avoid any friction involved with waiting hours in lines, verifying that there are no duplicate distributions, etc. Secure, in order to make sure that funds are provided to the people and do not end up in Hamas hands. Transparent, in order to provide accountability to the funders and perhaps even encourage more giving. img</p><p  class='text-p'><figure class='image'><img src="../assets/img/blog/qatari-aid-and-cbdc-can-change-international-giving/img1.jpeg" alt="img"></figure></p><p  class='text-p'><em>Palestinians receive their financial aid, 100 USD per needy family offered by Qatar, at a post office in Gaza City on June 27, 2020. (Photo by MAHMUD HAMS / AFP)</em></p><p  class='text-p'>It is estimated that over <a href="https://www.fmo.nl/news-detail/9fc7842f-3e08-4390-96e5-73cd9a06d215/reaching-the-unbanked-in-the-palestinian-territories" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>50% of the adult population</a> in Gaza is unbanked. Consequently, it is not surprising that the current funds distribution mechanism is very rudimentary – Gazans stand in line to receive $100 per family. No doubt that it is neither smooth nor secure, and I would also argue questionably transparent.</p><p  class='text-p'>Technology and innovation can significantly improve the process. We can now create an efficient mechanism to distribute aid funds and satisfy all three of the above-discussed requirements.</p><p  class='text-p'>The platform would utilize the Orbs funds track and trace solution, deployed with CBDC, and would work as follows:</p><ul>
<li>The Bank of Israel delegates Palestinian banks to open digital accounts to Gaza citizens. This procedure involves a standard KYC to verify recipients’ identity and eligibility for aid. The accounts will be operated using a mobile application. Naturally, in order for the funds to have a proper use, business places and service providers in Gaza will also require digital wallets. They will undergo the same KYC procedure.</li>
<li>The funds from Qatar are wired to the Bank of Israel by a wire transfer, rather than cash. Upon their receipt they will be converted into Digital Shekels and transferred to a designated bank account, operated by a third party humanitarian organization who will supervise or control the process, similar to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-agrees-to-take-over-distribution-of-qatari-funds-in-gaza-report/" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>the role of the UN in the most recent distribution.</a></li>
<li>From the designated account the funds are transferred directly to Gazans’ digital accounts, i.e. <strong>directly to their mobile devices.</strong></li>
<li>All the wire transfers are fully tracked and accessible to relevant parties only, in order to assure that the entire amount was properly distributed to the people in Gaza</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Clearly, there are significant benefits to using this platform instead of continuing with cash distributions:</p><ul>
<li>Once users are onboarded to the platform and their new digital wallets are up and running, the distribution can be fully automated. Meaning that they do not have to stand hours in line for aid funds, and that paperwork becomes redundant. The platform provides a full, detailed and immutable report of the distributions. It is then available for the inspection of all relevant parties, <strong>online and in real-time.</strong></li>
<li>Onboarding users should be fast and simple as the recipients of aid funds are already known to the aid systems, and have undergone onboarding procedures to verify they are entitled to these funds. In addition, as most, if not all, of them already have a smart mobile device, opening the digital wallet would just require downloading the application and providing their credentials</li>
<li>Proper KYC would make it very hard for terror-related parties to get their hands on these funds. Rigorous KYC should prevent them from opening digital wallets, thus depriving them of access to the platform. Moreover, in case they do manage to somehow get a hold of digital wallets, these addresses can be blacklisted and blocked for future use. Furthermore, chain analysis features would assist in tracking the sources of the aid funds gone rogue, to fight future attempts of exploiting aid funds. As a result, it would be easier to make sure that the funds reach their rightful destinations.</li>
<li>Migration to digital wallets will spur financial innovation in Gaza, as <strong>it will de-facto bank the unbankables.</strong> These wallets will provide many Gazans with access to financial services never before accessible, e.g. saving accounts, insurance, pension funds and more. This can potentially be the most significant step towards their financial well-being, and is an additional benefit that should not be <a href="../does-defi-hold-a-promise-for-the-unbanked" rel="noopener">overlooked</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p  class='text-p'>Of course, like every system, this one has its challenges. As is the case with any CBDC platform, user privacy is an issue. The ledger is immutable, meaning that all transactions are documented forever. Even if the platform is not public and permissionless, it still means that authorized parties will have full access to aid funds recipients’ transaction history. One may rightfully argue that this is a severe infringement of their privacy. I tend to agree to a certain extent, with two objections. The first is that this so-called infringement is inherent to CBDC platforms in general, not necessarily Orbs funds track and trace solution. By the way, there are already several suggestions to tackle this type of privacy challenges. Second, as I have repeated several times while discussing this topic, the enemy of the good is the perfect. A functioning and practical system that satisfies core requirements in an area of conflict and terror can never be a perfect solution. Currently, the international community is <a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/sen-risch-wont-lift-hold-on-palestinian-aid-without-guarantee-taxpayer-money-is-kept-from-terrorists/amp/?__twitter_impression=true" rel="noopener" target='_blank'>underfunding Gaza</a> due to the justifiable concern that Hamas will use the monies to support terror activities. Would it not be better to instead deploy a solution now that would profoundly impact Gazans’ financial well-being, and improve user privacy in future versions?</p><p  class='text-p'>The situation in Gaza is dire. If Hamas continues to utilize aid funds to construct tunnels and purchase military equipment, the cycle of violence will continue, and even as Gaza is rebuilt – it will only be temporary until the next conflict. However, if Hamas does not have access to aid funds due to a transparent and efficient system that truly directs funds towards citizens and not to a terrorist organization, then perhaps we can create a respite from the conflict. A lot needs to happen before the lives of the people in Gaza improve. For decades, international communities have reached out in an attempt to assist, only to see their funds go astray. It is time for accountability and for transparency. Using a CBDC based track and trace solution is a clear step forward that would ameliorate the situation, strengthen the financial independence of innocent civilians, and ensure donor countries that their monies are being used for good instead of evil.</p></div></div></div></ul></div><div class="footer-tweets"><section class="footer-section-title"><img
