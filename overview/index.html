The main offerings of the platform include compute under consensus (execution of “smart contracts”) and storage under consensus. Applications running on public blockchain are unique in their ability to facilitate trust by providing blockchain-backed guarantees to their users. Whereas many popular public blockchain solutions like Ethereum are designed primarily for purely decentralized applications (dapps), Orbs expands the offerings of public blockchains by also supporting permissioned applications developed by existing for-profit businesses.</p>
</div></div><div class="text-with-title" data-aos="fade-up"><h5>COMPLETE BLOCKCHAIN STACK</h5><div class="text-box-base-text"><p data-aos=fade-up>The Orbs project includes a full blockchain stack designed and implemented from scratch by the core team, and is not a fork of any existing solution. The project is active on open source with about 150 repositories publicly available on Github. The codebase provides an end-to-end developer experience with everything needed to create and execute blockchain applications including:</p>

Virtualization provides applications with an isolated environment while utilizing a shared physical infrastructure of nodes. Each virtual chain maintains its own separate chain of blocks, state, and runs its own concurrent instance of consensus. All Orbs validators run all virtual chains in parallel, making the permissionless pool of validators completely shared and staked across the full network. This provides applications with the security and decentralization of the entire network while maintaining a strong degree of independence. Consensus on transactions of different virtual chains can be run independently and are run concurrently on separate resources. The ledgers of virtual chains can also be maintained independently and their compute can be performed in parallel. Moreover, the isolation of state for each virtual chain reduces the memory requirements of the network’s virtual machine.</p>
